This is a translation of an old book—indeed, in Internet time, it is a transla-<br/>tion of an ancient text. The first edition of this book was published in 1999.<br/>It was written in a very different context, and, in many ways, it was written in<br/>opposition to that context. As I describe in the first chapter, the dominant idea<br/>among those who raved about cyberspace then was that cyberspace was<br/>beyond the reach of real-space regulation. Governments couldn’t touch life<br/>online. And hence, life online would be different, and separate, from the<br/>dynamic of life offline. <i>Code </i>v1 was an argument against that then common<br/>view.<br/>
In the years since, that common view has faded. The confidence of the<br/>
Internet exceptionalists has waned. The idea—and even the desire—that the<br/>Internet would remain unregulated is gone. And thus, in accepting the invita-<br/>tion to update this book, I faced a difficult choice: whether to write a new<br/>book, or to update the old, to make it relevant and readable in a radically dif-<br/>ferent time.<br/>
I’ve done the latter. The basic structure of the first edition remains, and<br/>
the argument advanced is the same. But I’ve changed the framing of particu-<br/>lar examples, and, I hope, the clarity of the writing. I’ve also extended the<br/>argument in some parts, and added brief links to later work in order to better<br/>integrate the argument of the original book.<br/>
One thing I have not done, however, is extend the argument of this book<br/>
in the places that others have worked. Nor have I succumbed to the (insanely<br/>powerful) temptation to rewrite the book as a response to critics, both sym-<br/>pathetic and not. I have included direction in the notes for those wanting to<br/>follow the arguments others have made in response. But, even more than<br/>when it was first published, this book is just a small part of a much bigger<br/>debate. Thus, you shouldn’t read this to the exclusion of extraordinary later<br/>work. Two books in particular already published nicely complement the argu-<br/>ment made here—Goldsmith and Wu’s <i>Who Controls the Net? </i>(2006), and<br/>Benkler’s <i>The Wealth of Networks </i>(2006)—and a third by Zittrain, expected in<br/>2007, significantly extends the same argument.<br/>



preface to the second edition<br/>
I have also not tried to enumerate the mistakes, real and alleged, made in<br/>
the first edition. Some I’ve simply corrected, and some I’ve kept, because,<br/>however mistaken others take them to be, I continue to believe that they are<br/>not mistakes. The most important of the second type is my view that the<br/>infrastructure of the Net will become increasingly controlled and regulable<br/>through digital identity technologies. Friends have called this “mistake” a<br/>“whopper.” It is not. I’m not sure what time horizon I had in mind in 1999,<br/>and I concede that some of the predictions made there have not come to<br/>pass—yet. But I am more confident today than I was then, and thus I have<br/>chosen to stick with this “fundamental mistake.” Perhaps this is simply to<br/>hedge my bets: If I’m right, then I have the reward of understanding. If I’m<br/>wrong, then we’ll have an Internet closer to the values of its original design.<br/>
The genesis of the revisions found here was a wiki. Basic Books allowed<br/>
me to post the original edition of the book in a wiki hosted by Jotspot, and a<br/>team of “chapter captains” helped facilitate a conversation about the text.<br/>There were some edits to the text itself, and many more valuable comments<br/>and criticisms.1 I then took that text as of the end of 2005 and added my own<br/>edits to produce this book. While I wouldn’t go as far as the musician Jeff<br/>Tweedy (“Half of it’s you, half is me”), an important part of this is not my<br/>work. In recognition of that, I’ve committed the royalties from this book to<br/>the nonprofit Creative Commons.<br/>
I am grateful to JotSpot (&lt;jot.com&gt;) for donating the wiki and hosting<br/>
services that were used to edit <i>Code </i>v1<i>. </i>That wiki was managed by an<br/>extraordinary Stanford undergraduate, Jake Wachman, who gave this project<br/>more time than he had. Each chapter of the book, while living on the wiki,<br/>had a “chapter captain.” I am grateful to each of them—Ann Bartow, Richard<br/>Belew, Seth Finkelstein, Joel Flynn, Mia Garlick, Matt Goodell, Paul Gowder,<br/>Peter Harter, Brian Honermann, Brad Johnson, Jay Kesan, John Logie, Tom<br/>Maddox, Ellen Rigsby, and Jon Stewart—for the work they volunteered to do,<br/>and to the many volunteers who spent their time trying to make <i>Code </i>v1 bet-<br/>ter. I am especially grateful to Andy Oram for his extensive contributions to<br/>the wiki.<br/>
In addition to these volunteers, Stanford helped me gather an army of<br/>
law students to help complete the research that <i>Code </i>v2 required. This work<br/>began with four—David Ryan Brumberg, Jyh-An Lee, Bret Logue, and Adam<br/>Pugh—who spent a summer collecting all the work that built upon or criti-<br/>cized <i>Code </i>v1<i>. </i>I relied upon that research in part to decide how to modify<br/><i>Code </i>v1<i>. </i>During the fall semester, 2005, a seminar of Stanford students added<br/>their own critical take, as well as classes at Cardozo Law School. And then<br/>during the year, two other students, John Eden and Avi Lev Robinson-<br/>

preface to the second edition<br/>

Mosher, spent many hours helping me complete the research necessary to<br/>finish a reasonable draft of <i>Code </i>v2<i>.</i><br/>
No student, however, contributed as much to the final version of <i>Code </i>v2<br/>
as Christina Gagnier. In the final months of this project, she took command<br/>of the research, completing a gaggle of unresolved questions, putting the<br/>results of this 18-month process in a form that could be published, and super-<br/>vising a check of all citations to verify their completeness and accuracy. With-<br/>out her work, this book would not have been completed.<br/>
I am also grateful to friends and colleagues who have helped me see how<br/>
this work needed to change—especially Ed Felten, David Johnson, Jorge Lima,<br/>Alan Rothman, and Tim Wu. Jason Ralls designed the graphics for <i>Code </i>v2.<br/>And finally, I am indebted beyond words to Elaine Adolfo, whose talent and<br/>patience are far beyond anything I’ve ever known, and without whom I could<br/>not have done this, or much else in the past few years.<br/>

In the spring of 1996, at an annual conference organized under the title “Com-<br/>puters, Freedom, and Privacy” (CFP), two science-fiction writers were invited<br/>to tell stories about cyberspace’s future. Vernor Vinge spoke about “ubiquitous<br/>law enforcement” made possible by “fine-grained distributed systems,” in which<br/>the technology that will enable our future way of life also feeds data to, and<br/>accepts commands from, the government. The architecture that would enable<br/>this was already being built—it was the Internet—and technologists were<br/>already describing ways in which it could be extended. As this network which<br/>could allow such control became woven into every part of social life, it would<br/>be just a matter of time, Vinge said, before the government claimed control over<br/>vital parts of this system. As the system matured, each new generation of system<br/>code would increase the power of government. Our digital selves—and increas-<br/>ingly, our physical selves—would live in a world of perfect regulation, and the<br/>architecture of this distributed computing—what we today call the Internet<br/>and its successors—would make that regulatory perfection possible.<br/>
Tom Maddox followed Vinge and told a similar story, though with a<br/>
slightly different cast. The government’s power would not come just from<br/>chips, he argued. Instead, it would be reinforced by an alliance between gov-<br/>ernment and commerce. Commerce, like government, fares better in a well-<br/>regulated world. Commerce would, whether directly or indirectly, help supply<br/>resources to build a well-regulated world. Cyberspace would thus change to<br/>take on characteristics favorable to these two powerful forces of social order.<br/>Accountability would emerge from the fledgling, wild Internet.<br/>
Code and commerce.<br/>When these two authors spoke, the future they described was not yet<br/>
present. Cyberspace was increasingly everywhere, but it was very hard for<br/>those in the audience to imagine it tamed to serve the ends of government.<br/>And at that time, commerce was certainly interested in cyberspace, though<br/>credit card companies were still warning customers to stay far away from the<br/>Net. The Net was an exploding social space of something. But it was hard to<br/>see it as an exploding space of social control.<br/>



preface to the first edition<br/>
I didn’t see either speech. I first listened to them through my computer,<br/>
three years after they were given. Their words had been recorded; they now sit<br/>archived on a server at MIT.1 It takes a second to tune in and launch the<br/>recording of their speeches. The very act of listening to these lectures given<br/>years before—served on a reliable and indexed platform that no doubt<br/>recorded the fact that I had listened, across high-speed, commercial Internet<br/>lines that feed my house both the Internet and ABC News—confirmed some-<br/>thing of their account. One can hear in the audience’s reaction a recognition<br/>that these authors were talking fiction—they were science-fiction writers,<br/>after all. But the fiction they spoke terrified those who listened.<br/>
Ten years later, these tales are no longer fiction. It is no longer hard to<br/>
understand how the Net could become a more perfectly regulated space or<br/>how the forces behind commerce could play a role in facilitating that regula-<br/>tion.<br/>
The ongoing battle over peer-to-peer filesharing is an easy example of<br/>
this dynamic. As an astonishing quantity of music files (among others) was<br/>made available for free (and against the law of copyright) through P2P<br/>applications, the recording industry has fought back. Its strategy has<br/>included vigorous prosecution of those downloading music illegally,<br/>extraordinary efforts to secure new legislation to add new protections for<br/>their copyrighted content, and a host of new technical measures designed to<br/>change a feature of the original architecture of the network—namely that<br/>the Net copies content blind to the rules of copyright that stand behind that<br/>content. The battle is thus joined, and the outcome will have implications<br/>for more than just music distribution. But the form of the battle is clear:<br/>commerce and government working to change the infrastructure to make<br/>better control possible.<br/>
Vinge and Maddox were first-generation theorists of cyberspace. They<br/>
could tell their stories about perfect control because they lived in a world that<br/>couldn’t be controlled. They could connect with their audience because it<br/>wanted to resist the future they described. Envisioning this impossible world<br/>was sport.<br/>
Now the impossible is increasingly real. Much of the control in Vinge’s<br/>
and Maddox’s stories that struck many of their listeners as Orwellian now<br/>seems to many quite reasonable. It is possible to imagine the system of perfect<br/>regulation that Vinge described, and some even like what they see. It is<br/>inevitable that an increasingly large part of the Internet will be fed by com-<br/>merce. Most don’t see anything wrong with that either. The “terrifying” has<br/>now become normal, and only the historians (or authors of old books like<br/>this) will notice the difference.<br/>

preface to the first edition<br/>

This book continues Vinge’s and Maddox’s stories. I share their view of<br/>
the Net’s future; much of this book is about the expanding architecture of reg-<br/>ulation that the Internet will become. But I don’t share the complacency of the<br/>self-congratulatory cheers echoing in the background of that 1996 recording.<br/>It may well have been obvious in 1996 who “the enemy” was. But it is not<br/>obvious now.<br/>
The argument of this book is that our future is neither Vinge’s nor Mad-<br/>
dox’s accounts standing alone. Our future is the two woven together. If we<br/>were only in for the dystopia described by Vinge, we would have an obvious<br/>and powerful response: Orwell gave us the tools, and Stalin gave us the resolve<br/>to resist the totalitarian state. After 9/11, we may well see a spying and invasive<br/>Net. But even that will have limits. Totalitarian control by Washington is not<br/>our future. <i>1984 </i>is solidly in our past.<br/>
Likewise, if we were only in for the future that Maddox described, many<br/>
of our citizens would call that utopia, not science fiction. A world where “the<br/>market” runs free and the “evil” of government is defeated would be, for them,<br/>a world of perfect freedom.<br/>
But when you tie the futures described by Vinge and Maddox together, it<br/>
is a different picture altogether: A future of control in large part exercised by<br/>technologies of commerce, backed by the rule of law (or at least what’s left of<br/>the rule of law).<br/>
The challenge for our generation is to reconcile these two forces. How do<br/>
we protect liberty when the architectures of control are managed as much by<br/>the government as by the private sector? How do we assure privacy when the<br/>ether perpetually spies? How do we guarantee free thought when the push is<br/>to propertize every idea? How do we guarantee self-determination when the<br/>architectures of control are perpetually determined elsewhere? How, in other<br/>words, do we build a world of liberty in the face of the dangers that Vinge and<br/>Maddox together describe?<br/>
The answer is not in the knee-jerk antigovernment rhetoric of a libertar-<br/>
ian past: Governments are necessary to protect liberty, even if they are also<br/>able to destroy it. But neither does the answer lie in a return to Roosevelt’s<br/>New Deal. Statism has failed. Liberty is not to be found in some new D.C.<br/>alphabet soup (WPA, FCC, FDA . . . ) of bureaucracy.<br/>
A second generation takes the ideals of the first and works them out<br/>
against a different background. It knows the old debates; it has mapped the<br/>dead-end arguments of the preceding thirty years. The objective of a second<br/>generation is to ask questions that avoid dead-ends and move beyond them.<br/>
There is great work from both generations. Esther Dyson and John Perry<br/>
Barlow, and Todd Lapin still inspire, and still move one (Dyson is editor at<br/>


preface to the first edition<br/>
large at CNET Networks; Barlow now spends time at Harvard). And in the<br/>second generation, the work of Andrew Shapiro, David Shenk, and Steven<br/>Johnson is becoming well known and is compelling.<br/>
My aim is this second generation. As fits my profession (I’m a lawyer), my<br/>
contribution is more long-winded, more obscure, more technical, and more<br/>obtuse than the best of either generation. But as fits my profession, I’ll offer it<br/>anyway. In the debates that rage right now, what I have to say will not please<br/>anyone very much. And as I peck these last words before e-mailing the man-<br/>uscript off to the publisher, I can already hear the reactions: “Can’t you tell the<br/>difference between the power of the sheriff and the power of Walt Disney?”<br/>“Do you really think we need a government agency regulating software code?”<br/>And from the other side: “How can you argue for an architecture of cyber-<br/>space (free software) that disables government’s ability to do good?”<br/>
But I am also a teacher. If my writing produces angry reactions, then it<br/>
might also effect a more balanced reflection. These are hard times to get it<br/>right, but the easy answers to yesterday’s debate won’t get it right.<br/>
I have learned an extraordinary amount from the teachers and critics<br/>
who have helped me write this book. Hal Abelson, Bruce Ackerman, James<br/>Boyle, Jack Goldsmith, and Richard Posner gave patient and excellent advice<br/>on earlier drafts. I am grateful for their patience and extremely fortunate to<br/>have had their advice. Larry Vale and Sarah Whiting guided my reading in the<br/>field of architecture, though no doubt I was not as patient a student as I<br/>should have been. Sonya Mead helped me put into pictures what it would take<br/>a lawyer ten thousand words to say.<br/>
An army of students did most of the battle on earlier drafts of this book.<br/>
Carolyn Bane, Rachel Barber, Enoch Chang, Ben Edelman, Timothy Ehrlich,<br/>Dawn Farber, Melanie Glickson, Bethany Glover, Nerlyn Gonzalez, Shannon<br/>Johnson, Karen King, Alex Macgillivray, Marcus Maher, David Melaugh,<br/>Teresa Ou, Laura Pirri, and Wendy Seltzer provided extensive, if respectful,<br/>criticism. And my assistants, Lee Hopkins and Catherine Cho, were crucial in<br/>keeping this army in line (and at bay).<br/>
Three students in particular have influenced my argument, though none<br/>
are fairly called “students.” Harold Reeves takes the lead in Chapter 10. Tim<br/>Wu forced me to rethink much of Part I. And Andrew Shapiro showed me the<br/>hopefulness in a future that I have described in very dark terms.<br/>
I am especially indebted to Catherine Marguerite Manley, whose extraor-<br/>
dinary talent, both as a writer and a researcher, made it possible to finish this<br/>work long before it otherwise could have been finished. Thanks also to Tawen<br/>Chang and James Stahir for their careful review of the notes and work to<br/>keep them honest.<br/>

preface to the first edition<br/>

This is a not a field where one learns by living in libraries. I have learned<br/>
everything I know from the conversations I have had, or watched, with an<br/>extraordinary community of academics and activists, who have been strug-<br/>gling over the last five years both to understand what cyberspace is and to<br/>make it better. This community includes the scholars and writers I discuss in<br/>the text, especially the lawyers Yochai Benkler, James Boyle, Mark Lemley,<br/>David Post, and Pam Samuelson. I’ve also benefited greatly from conversa-<br/>tions with nonlawyers, especially Hal Abelson, John Perry Barlow, Todd Lapin,<br/>Joseph Reagle, Paul Resnick, and Danny Weitzner. But perhaps more impor-<br/>tantly, I’ve benefited from discussions with the activists, in particular the Cen-<br/>ter for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and<br/>the American Civil Liberties Union. They have made the issues real, and they<br/>have done much to defend at least some of the values that I think important.<br/>
This book would not have been written, however, but for a story by Julian<br/>
Dibbell, a conference organized by Henry J. Perritt, and many arguments with<br/>David Johnson. I am grateful to all three for what they have taught.<br/>
I began this project as a fellow at Harvard’s Program on Ethics and the<br/>
Professions. I am grateful to Dennis Thompson for his skeptical encourage-<br/>ment that year. The Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law<br/>School has made much of my research possible. I am grateful in particular to<br/>Lillian and Myles Berkman for that support, and especially to the center’s co-<br/>director and my sometime coteacher, Jonathan Zittrain, for his support and,<br/>more important, friendship. I’ve dedicated this book to the other co-director<br/>of the Berkman Center, Charlie Nesson, who has given me the space and sup-<br/>port to do this work and a certain inspiration to push it differently.<br/>
But more significant than any of that support has been the patience, and<br/>
love, of the person to whom I’ve dedicated my life, Bettina Neuefeind. Her<br/>love will seem crazy, and wonderful, for much more than a year.<br/>

l a w<br/>
ALMOST TWO DECADES AGO, IN THE SPRING OF 1989, COMMUNISM IN EUROPE<br/>died—collapsed, like a tent, its main post removed. The end was not brought<br/>by war or revolution. The end was exhaustion. A new political regime was<br/>born in its place across Central and Eastern Europe, the beginnings of a new<br/>political society.<br/>
For constitutionalists (like me), this was a heady time. I had graduated<br/>
from law school in 1989, and in 1991 I began teaching at the University of<br/>Chicago. At that time, Chicago had a center devoted to the study of the emerg-<br/>ing democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. I was a part of that center.<br/>Over the next five years I spent more hours on airplanes, and more mornings<br/>drinking bad coffee, than I care to remember.<br/>
Eastern and Central Europe were filled with Americans telling former<br/>
Communists how they should govern. The advice was endless. And silly. Some<br/>of these visitors literally sold translated constitutions to the emerging consti-<br/>tutional republics; the rest had innumerable half-baked ideas about how the<br/>new nations should be governed. These Americans came from a nation where<br/>constitutionalism seemed to work, yet they had no clue why.<br/>
The Center’s mission, however, was not to advise. We knew too little to<br/>
guide. Our aim was to watch and gather data about the transitions and how<br/>they progressed. We wanted to understand the change, not direct it.<br/>
What we saw was striking, if understandable. Those first moments after<br/>
communism’s collapse were filled with antigovernmental passion—a surge of<br/>anger directed against the state and against state regulation. Leave us alone,<br/>the people seemed to say. Let the market and nongovernmental organiza-<br/>tions—a new society—take government’s place. After generations of com-<br/>munism, this reaction was completely understandable. Government was the<br/>
1<br/>

CODE 2.0<br/>
oppressor. What compromise could there be with the instrument of your<br/>repression?<br/>
A certain kind of libertarianism seemed to many to support much in this<br/>
reaction. If the market were to reign, and the government were kept out of the<br/>way, freedom and prosperity would inevitably grow. Things would take care<br/>of themselves. There was no need, and could be no place, for extensive regu-<br/>lation by the state.<br/>
But things didn’t take care of themselves. Markets didn’t flourish. Govern-<br/>
ments were crippled, and crippled governments are no elixir of freedom.<br/>Power didn’t disappear—it shifted from the state to mafiosi, themselves often<br/>created by the state. The need for traditional state functions—police, courts,<br/>schools, health care—didn’t go away, and private interests didn’t emerge to fill<br/>that need. Instead, the needs were simply unmet. Security evaporated. A mod-<br/>ern if plodding anarchy replaced the bland communism of the previous three<br/>generations: neon lights flashed advertisements for Nike; pensioners were<br/>swindled out of their life savings by fraudulent stock deals; bankers were mur-<br/>dered in broad daylight on Moscow streets. One system of control had been<br/>replaced by another. Neither was what Western libertarians would call “free-<br/>dom.”<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
About a decade ago, in the mid-1990s, just about the time when this post-<br/>communist euphoria was beginning to wane, there emerged in the West<br/>another “new society,” to many just as exciting as the new societies promised<br/>in post-communist Europe. This was the Internet, or as I’ll define a bit later,<br/>“cyberspace.” First in universities and centers of research, and then through-<br/>out society in general, cyberspace became a new target for libertarian utopi-<br/>anism. <i>Here </i>freedom from the state would reign. If not in Moscow or Tblisi,<br/>then in cyberspace would we find the ideal libertarian society.<br/>
The catalyst for this change was likewise unplanned. Born in a research<br/>
project in the Defense Department,1 cyberspace too arose from the unplanned<br/>displacement of a certain architecture of control. The tolled, single-purpose<br/>network of telephones was displaced by the untolled and multipurpose net-<br/>work of packet-switched data. And thus the old one-to-many architectures of<br/>publishing (television, radio, newspapers, books) were complemented by a<br/>world in which anyone could become a publisher. People could communicate<br/>and associate in ways that they had never done before. The space seemed to<br/>promise a kind of society that real space would never allow—freedom without<br/>anarchy, control without government, consensus without power. In the words<br/>of a manifesto that defined this ideal: “We reject: kings, presidents and voting.<br/>We believe in: rough consensus and running code.”2<br/>

code is law<br/>
3<br/>
As in post-Communist Europe, these first thoughts about freedom in<br/>
cyberspace tied freedom to the disappearance of the state. As John Parry Bar-<br/>low, former lyricist for the Grateful Dead and co-founder of the Electronic<br/>Frontier Foundation, declared in his “Declaration of Independence for Cyber-<br/>space,”<br/>
Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come<br/>
from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of<br/>
the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sover-<br/>
eignty where we gather.<br/>
But here the bond between freedom and the absence of the state was said<br/>
to be even stronger than in post-Communist Europe. The claim for cyber-<br/>space was not just that government would not regulate cyberspace—it was<br/>that government <i>could not </i>regulate cyberspace. Cyberspace was, by nature,<br/>unavoidably free. Governments could threaten, but behavior could not be<br/>controlled; laws could be passed, but they would have no real effect. There was<br/>no choice about what kind of government to install—none could reign.<br/>Cyberspace would be a society of a very different sort. There would be defini-<br/>tion and direction, but built from the bottom-up. The society of this space<br/>would be a fully self-ordering entity, cleansed of governors and free from<br/>political hacks.<br/>
I taught in Central Europe during the summers of the early 1990s; I wit-<br/>
nessed through my students the transformation in attitudes about communism<br/>that I described above. And so I felt a bit of déjà vu when, in the spring of 1995,<br/>while teaching the law of cyberspace, I saw in my students these very same post-<br/>communist thoughts about freedom and government. Even at Yale—not known<br/>for libertarian passions—the students seemed drunk with what James Boyle<br/>would later call the “libertarian gotcha”:3 no government could survive without<br/>the Internet’s riches, yet no government could control the life that went on<br/>there. Real-space governments would become as pathetic as the last Communist<br/>regimes: It was the withering of the state that Marx had promised, jolted out of<br/>existence by trillions of gigabytes flashing across the ether of cyberspace.<br/>
But what was never made clear in the midst of this celebration was <i>why</i>.<br/>
Why was cyberspace incapable of regulation? What made it so? The word<br/>itself suggests not freedom but control. Its etymology reaches beyond a novel<br/>by William Gibson (<i>Neuromancer, </i>published in 1984) to the world of “cyber-<br/>netics,” the study of control at a distance through devices.4 So it was doubly<br/>puzzling to see this celebration of “perfect freedom” under a banner that<br/>aspires (to anyone who knows the origin, at least) to perfect control.<br/>

As I said, I am a constitutionalist. I teach and write about constitutional<br/>
law. I believe that these first thoughts about government and cyberspace were<br/>just as misguided as the first thoughts about government after communism.<br/>Liberty in cyberspace will not come from the absence of the state. Liberty<br/>there, as anywhere, will come from a state of a certain kind. We build a world<br/>where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious<br/>control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious<br/>control survives. We build liberty as our founders did, by setting society upon<br/>a certain <i>constitution</i>.<br/>
But by “constitution” I don’t mean a legal text. Unlike my countrymen in<br/>
Eastern Europe in the early 1990s, I am not trying to sell a document that our<br/>framers wrote in 1787. Rather, as the British understand when they speak of<br/>their “constitution,” I mean an architecture—not just a legal text but a way of<br/>life—that structures and constrains social and legal power, to the end of pro-<br/>tecting fundamental values. (One student asked, “constitution” in the sense of<br/>“just one tool among many, one simple flashlight that keeps us from fumbling<br/>in the dark, or, alternatively . . . more like a lighthouse that we constantly call<br/>upon?” I mean constitution as in lighthouse—a guide that helps anchor fun-<br/>damental values.)<br/>
Constitutions in this sense are built, they are not found. Foundations get<br/>
laid, they don’t magically appear. Just as the founders of our nation learned<br/>from the anarchy that followed the revolution (remember: our first constitu-<br/>tion, the Articles of Confederation, was a miserable failure of do-nothing-<br/>ness), so too are we beginning to understand about cyberspace that this<br/>building, or laying, is not the work of an invisible hand. There is no reason to<br/>believe that the foundation for liberty in cyberspace will simply emerge.<br/>Indeed, the passion for that anarchy—as in America by the late 1780s, and as<br/>in the former Eastern bloc by the late 1990s—has faded. Thus, as our framers<br/>learned, and as the Russians saw, we have every reason to believe that cyber-<br/>space, left to itself, will not fulfill the promise of freedom. Left to itself, cyber-<br/>space will become a perfect tool of control.<br/>
Control. Not necessarily control by government, and not necessarily<br/>
control to some evil, fascist end. But the argument of this book is that the<br/>invisible hand of cyberspace is building an architecture that is quite the<br/>opposite of its architecture at its birth. This invisible hand, pushed by gov-<br/>ernment and by commerce, is constructing an architecture that will perfect<br/>control and make highly efficient regulation possible. The struggle in that<br/>world will not be government’s. It will be to assure that essential liberties are<br/>preserved in this environment of perfect control. As Siva Vaidhyanathan<br/>puts it,<br/>

code is law<br/>
5<br/>
While once it seemed obvious and easy to declare the rise of a ”network society”<br/>
in which individuals would realign themselves, empower themselves, and under-<br/>
mine traditional methods of social and cultural control, it seems clear that net-<br/>
worked digital communication need not serve such liberating ends.5<br/>
This book is about the change from a cyberspace of anarchy to a cyber-<br/>
space of control. When we see the path that cyberspace is on now—an evolu-<br/>tion I describe below in Part I—we see that much of the “liberty” present at<br/>cyberspace’s founding will be removed in its future. Values originally consid-<br/>ered fundamental will not survive. On the path we have chosen, we will<br/>remake what cyberspace was. Some of that remaking will make many of us<br/>happy. But some of that remaking, I argue, we should all regret.<br/>
Yet whether you celebrate or regret the changes that I will describe, it is<br/>
critical to understand how they happen. What produced the “liberty” of<br/>cyberspace, and what will change to remake that liberty? That lesson will then<br/>suggest a second about the source of regulation in cyberspace.<br/>
That understanding is the aim of Part II. Cyberspace demands a new<br/>
understanding of how regulation works. It compels us to look beyond the<br/>traditional lawyer’s scope—beyond laws, or even norms. It requires a broader<br/>account of “regulation,” and most importantly, the recognition of a newly<br/>salient regulator.<br/>
That regulator is the obscurity in this book’s title—Code. In real space, we<br/>
recognize how laws regulate—through constitutions, statutes, and other legal<br/>codes. In cyberspace we must understand how a different “code” regulates—<br/>how the software and hardware (i.e., the “code” of cyberspace) that make<br/>cyberspace what it is also regulate cyberspace as it is. As William Mitchell<br/>puts it, this code is cyberspace’s “law.”6 “Lex Informatica,” as Joel Reidenberg<br/>first put it,7 or better, “code is law.”<br/>
Lawyers and legal theorists get bothered, however, when I echo this slo-<br/>
gan. There are differences, they insist, between the regulatory effects produced<br/>by code and the regulatory effects produced by law, not the least of which is<br/>the difference in the “internal perspective” that runs with each kind of regu-<br/>lation. We understand the internal perspective of legal regulation—for exam-<br/>ple, that the restrictions the law might impose on a company’s freedom to<br/>pollute are a product of self-conscious regulation, reflecting values of the<br/>society imposing that regulation. That perspective is harder to recognize with<br/>code. It could be there, but it need not. And no doubt this is just one of many<br/>important differences between “code” and “law.”<br/>
I don’t deny these differences. I only assert that we learn something useful<br/>
from ignoring them for a bit. Justice Holmes famously focused the regulator<br/>

6<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
on the “bad man.”8 He offered a theory of regulation that assumed that “bad<br/>man” at its core. His point was not that everyone was a “bad man”; the point<br/>instead was about how we could best construct systems of regulation.<br/>
My point is the same. I suggest we learn something if we think about the<br/>
“bot man” theory of regulation—one focused on the regulation of code. We<br/>will learn something important, in other words, if we imagine the target of<br/>regulation as a maximizing entity, and consider the range of tools the regula-<br/>tor has to control that machine.<br/>
Code will be a central tool in this analysis. It will present the greatest threat<br/>
to both liberal and libertarian ideals, as well as their greatest promise. We can<br/>build, or architect, or <i>code </i>cyberspace to protect values that we believe are fun-<br/>damental. Or we can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to allow those val-<br/>ues to disappear. There is no middle ground. There is no choice that does not<br/>include some kind of building. Code is never found; it is only ever made, and<br/>only ever made by us. As Mark Stefik puts it, “Different versions of [cyberspace]<br/>support different kinds of dreams. We choose, wisely or not.”9 Or again, code<br/>“determines which people can access which digital objects . . . How such pro-<br/>gramming regulates human interactions . . . depends on the choices made.”10<br/>Or, more precisely, a code of cyberspace, defining the freedoms and controls of<br/>cyberspace, will be built. About that there can be no debate. But by whom,<br/>and with what values? That is the only choice we have left to make.<br/>
My argument is not for some top-down form of control. The claim is<br/>
not that regulators must occupy Microsoft. A constitution envisions an envi-<br/>ronment; as Justice Holmes said, it “call[s] into life a being the development<br/>of which [cannot be] foreseen.”11 Thus, to speak of a constitution is not to<br/>describe a hundred-day plan. It is instead to identify the values that a space<br/>should guarantee. It is not to describe a “government”; it is not even to select<br/>(as if a single choice must be made) between bottom-up or top-down control.<br/>In speaking of a constitution in cyberspace we are simply asking: What values<br/>should be protected there? What values should be built into the space to<br/>encourage what forms of life?<br/>
The “values” at stake here are of two sorts—substantive and structural. In<br/>
the American constitutional tradition, we worried about the second first. The<br/>framers of the Constitution of 1787 (enacted without a Bill of Rights) were<br/>focused on structures of government. Their aim was to ensure that a partic-<br/>ular government (the federal government) did not become too powerful. And<br/>so they built into the Constitution’s design checks on the power of the federal<br/>government and limits on its reach over the states.<br/>
Opponents of that Constitution insisted that more checks were needed,<br/>
that the Constitution needed to impose substantive limits on government’s<br/>

code is law<br/>
7<br/>
power as well as structural limits. And thus was the Bill of Rights born. Rati-<br/>fied in 1791, the Bill of Rights promised that the federal government would<br/>not remove certain freedoms—of speech, privacy, and due process. And it<br/>guaranteed that the commitment to these substantive values would remain<br/>despite the passing fancies of normal, or ordinary, government. These val-<br/>ues—both substantive and structural—were thus entrenched through our<br/>constitutional design. They can be changed, but only through a cumbersome<br/>and costly process.<br/>
We face the same questions in constituting cyberspace, but we have<br/>
approached them from the opposite direction.12 Already we are struggling<br/>with substance: Will cyberspace promise privacy or access? Will it enable a free<br/>culture or a permission culture? Will it preserve a space for free speech? These<br/>are choices of substantive value, and they are the subject of much of this<br/>book.<br/>
But structure matters as well, though we have not even begun to under-<br/>
stand how to limit, or regulate, arbitrary regulatory power. What “checks and<br/>balances” are possible in this space? How do we separate powers? How do we<br/>ensure that one regulator, or one government, doesn’t become too powerful?<br/>How do we guarantee it is powerful enough?<br/>
Theorists of cyberspace have been talking about these questions since its<br/>
birth.13 But as a culture, we are just beginning to get it. As we slowly come to<br/>see how different structures within cyberspace affect us—how its architec-<br/>ture, in a sense I will define below, “regulates” us—we slowly come to ask<br/>how these structures should be defined. The first generation of these archi-<br/>tectures was built by a noncommercial sector—researchers and hackers,<br/>focused upon building a network. The second generation has been built by<br/>commerce. And the third, not yet off the drawing board, could well be the<br/>product of government. Which regulator do we prefer? Which regulators<br/>should be controlled? How does society exercise that control over entities<br/>that aim to control it?<br/>
In Part III, I bring these questions back down to the ground. I consider<br/>
three areas of controversy—intellectual property, privacy, and free speech—<br/>and identify the values within each that cyberspace will change. These values<br/>are the product of the interaction between law and technology. How that<br/>interaction plays out is often counter-intuitive. My aim in this part is to map<br/>that interaction, so as to map a way that we might, using the tools of Part II,<br/>preserve the values that are important to us within each context.<br/>
Part IV internationalizes these questions. Cyberspace is everywhere,<br/>
meaning those who populate cyberspace come from everywhere. How will the<br/>sovereigns of everywhere live with the claimed “sovereignty” of cyberspace? I<br/>

map a particular response that seems to me inevitable, and will reinforce the<br/>conclusion of Part I.<br/>
The final part, Part V, is the darkest. The central lesson of this book is that<br/>
cyberspace requires choices. Some of these are, and should be, private:<br/>Whether an author wants to enforce her copyright; how a citizen wants to<br/>protect his privacy. But some of these choices involve values that are collective.<br/>I end by asking whether we—meaning Americans—are up to the challenge<br/>that these choices present. Are we able to respond rationally—meaning both<br/>(1) are we able to respond without undue or irrational passion, and (2) do we<br/>have institutions capable of understanding and responding to these choices?<br/>
My strong sense is that we are not, at least now, able to respond rationally<br/>
to these challenges. We are at a stage in our history when we urgently need to<br/>make fundamental choices about values, but we should trust no institution of<br/>government to make such choices. Courts cannot do it, because as a legal<br/>culture we don’t want courts choosing among contested matters of values.<br/>Congress should not do it because, as a political culture, we are deeply skep-<br/>tical (and rightly so) about the product of this government. There is much to<br/>be proud of in our history and traditions. But the government we now have<br/>is a failure. Nothing important should be trusted to its control, even though<br/>everything important is.<br/>
Change is possible. I don’t doubt that revolutions remain in our future.<br/>
But I fear that it is too easy for the government, or specially powered interests,<br/>to dislodge these revolutions, and that too much will be at stake for it to allow<br/>real change to succeed. Our government has already criminalized the core<br/>ethic of this movement, transforming the meaning of <i>hacker </i>into something<br/>quite alien to its original sense. Through extremism in copyright regulation,<br/>it is criminalizing the core creativity that this network could produce. And this<br/>is only the beginning.<br/>
Things could be different. They are different elsewhere. But I don’t see<br/>
how they could be different for us just now. This no doubt is simply a confes-<br/>sion of the limits of my own imagination. I would be grateful to be proven<br/>wrong. I would be grateful to watch as we relearn—as the citizens of the for-<br/>mer Communist republics are learning—how to escape these disabling ideas<br/>about the possibilities for governance. But nothing in the past decade, and<br/>especially nothing in the past five years, has convinced me that my skepticism<br/>about governance was misplaced. Indeed, events have only reinforced that<br/>pessimism.<br/>

EVERYONE WHO IS READING THIS BOOK HAS USED THE INTERNET. SOME HAVE BEEN<br/>in “cyberspace.” The Internet is that medium through which your e-mail is<br/>delivered and web pages get published. It’s what you use to order books on<br/>Amazon or to check the times for local movies at Fandango. Google is on the<br/>Internet, as are Microsoft “help pages.”<br/>
But “cyberspace” is something more. Though built on top of the Internet,<br/>
cyberspace is a richer experience. Cyberspace is something you get pulled “into,”<br/>perhaps by the intimacy of instant message chat or the intricacy of “massively<br/>multiple online games” (“MMOGs” for short, or if the game is a role-playing<br/>game, then “MMORPGs”). Some in cyberspace believe they’re in a community;<br/>some confuse their lives with their cyberspace existence. Of course, no sharp<br/>line divides cyberspace from the Internet. But there is an important difference in<br/>experience between the two. Those who see the Internet simply as a kind of Yel-<br/>low-Pages-on-steroids won’t recognize what citizens of cyberspace speak of. For<br/>them, “cyberspace” is simply obscure.<br/>
Some of this difference is generational. For most of us over the age of 40,<br/>
there is no “cyberspace,” even if there is an Internet. Most of us don’t live a life<br/>online that would qualify as a life in “cyberspace.” But for our kids, cyberspace is<br/>increasingly their second life. There are millions who spend hundreds of hours<br/>a month in the alternative worlds of cyberspace—later on we will focus on one<br/>of these worlds, a game called “Second Life.”1 And thus while you may think to<br/>yourself, this alien space is nothing I need worry about because it’s nowhere I’ll<br/>ever be, if you care to understand anything about the world the next generation<br/>will inhabit, you should spend some time understanding “cyberspace.”<br/>
That is the aim of two of the stories that follow. These two describe cyber-<br/>
space. The other two describe aspects of the Internet more generally. My aim<br/>

through these four very different stories is to orient by sometimes disorienting.<br/>My hope is that you’ll come to understand four themes that will recur through-<br/>out this book. At the end of this chapter, I come clean about the themes and pro-<br/>vide a map. For now, just focus on the stories.<br/>
BORDERS<br/>
It was a very ordinary dispute, this argument between Martha Jones and her<br/>neighbors.2 It was the sort of dispute that people have had since the start of<br/>neighborhoods. It didn’t begin in anger. It began with a misunderstanding. In<br/>this world, misunderstandings like this are far too common. Martha thought<br/>about that as she wondered whether she should stay; there were other places she<br/>could go. Leaving would mean abandoning what she had built, but frustrations<br/>like this were beginning to get to her. Maybe, she thought, it was time to move on.<br/>
The argument was about borders—about where her land stopped. It seemed<br/>
like a simple idea, one you would have thought the powers-that-be would have<br/>worked out many years before. But here they were, her neighbor Dank and she,<br/>still fighting about borders. Or rather, about something fuzzy at the borders—<br/>about something of Martha’s that spilled over into the land of others. This was<br/>the fight, and it all related to what Martha did.<br/>
Martha grew flowers. Not just any flowers, but flowers with an odd sort of<br/>
power. They were beautiful flowers, and their scent entranced. But, however<br/>beautiful, these flowers were also poisonous. This was Martha’s weird idea: to<br/>make flowers of extraordinary beauty which, if touched, would kill. Strange no<br/>doubt, but no one said that Martha wasn’t strange. She was unusual, as was this<br/>neighborhood. But sadly, disputes like this were not.<br/>
The start of the argument was predictable enough. Martha’s neighbor, Dank,<br/>
had a dog. Dank’s dog died. The dog died because it had eaten a petal from one<br/>of Martha’s flowers. A beautiful petal, and now a dead dog. Dank had his own<br/>ideas about these flowers, and about this neighbor, and he expressed those<br/>ideas—perhaps with a bit too much anger, or perhaps with anger appropriate to<br/>the situation.<br/>
“There is no reason to grow deadly flowers,” Dank yelled across the fence.<br/>
“There’s no reason to get so upset about a few dead dogs,” Martha replied.“A dog<br/>can always be replaced. And anyway, why have a dog that suffers when dying? Get<br/>yourself a pain-free-death dog, and my petals will cause no harm.”<br/>
I came into the argument at about this time. I was walking by, in the way one<br/>
walks in this space. (At first I had teleported to get near, but we needn’t compli-<br/>cate the story with jargon. Let’s just say I was walking.) I saw the two neighbors<br/>becoming increasingly angry with each other. I had heard about the disputed<br/>

four puzzles from cyberspace<br/>

flowers—about how their petals carried poison. It seemed to me a simple prob-<br/>lem to solve, but I guess it’s simple only if you understand how problems like this<br/>are created.<br/>
Dank and Martha were angry because in a sense they were stuck. Both had<br/>
built a life in the neighborhood; they had invested many hours there. But both<br/>were coming to understand its limits. This is a common condition: We all build<br/>our lives in places with limits. We are all disappointed at times. What was differ-<br/>ent about Dank and Martha?<br/>
One difference was the nature of the space, or context, where their argument<br/>
was happening. This was not “real space” but virtual space. It was part of what I<br/>call “cyberspace.” The environment was a “massively multiple online game”<br/>(“MMOG”), and MMOG space is quite different from the space we call real.<br/>
Real space is the place where you are right now: your office, your den, maybe<br/>
by a pool. It’s a world defined by both laws that are man-made and others that are<br/>not. “Limited liability” for corporations is a man-made law. It means that the<br/>directors of a corporation (usually) cannot be held personally liable for the sins<br/>of the company. Limited life for humans is not a man-made law: That we all will<br/>die is not the result of a decision that Congress made. In real space, our lives are<br/>subject to both sorts of law, though in principle we could change one sort.<br/>
But there are other sorts of laws in real space as well. You bought this book,<br/>
I trust, or you borrowed it from someone who did. If you stole it, you are a thief,<br/>whether you are caught or not. Our language is a norm; norms are collectively<br/>determined. As our norms have been determined, your “stealing” makes you a<br/>thief, and not just because you took it. There are plenty of ways to take something<br/>but not be thought of as a thief. If you came across a dollar blowing in the wind,<br/>taking the money will not make you a thief; indeed, not taking the money makes<br/>you a chump. But stealing this book from the bookstore (even when there are so<br/>many left for others) marks you as a thief. Social norms make it so, and we live<br/>life subject to these norms.<br/>
Some of these norms can be changed collectively, if not individually. I can<br/>
choose to burn my draft card, but I cannot choose whether doing so will make<br/>me a hero or a traitor. I can refuse an invitation to lunch, but I cannot choose<br/>whether doing so will make me rude. I have choices in real life, but escaping the<br/>consequences of the choices I make is not one of them. Norms in this sense con-<br/>strain us in ways that are so familiar as to be all but invisible.<br/>
MMOG space is different. It is, first of all, a virtual space—like a cartoon on<br/>
a television screen, sometimes rendered to look three-dimensional. But unlike a<br/>cartoon, MMOG space enables you to control the characters on the screen in real<br/>time. At least, you control your character—one among many characters con-<br/>trolled by many others in this space. One builds the world one will inhabit here.<br/>

12<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
As a child, you grew up learning the physics that governed the world of Road<br/>Runner and Wile E. Coyote (violent but forgiving); your children will grow up<br/>making the world of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote (still violent, but maybe<br/>not so forgiving). They will define the space and then live out the story. Their<br/>choices will make the laws of that space real.<br/>
This is not to say that MMOG space is unreal. There is real life in MMOG<br/>
space, constituted by how people interact. The “space” describes where people<br/>interact—much as they interact in real space no doubt, but with some important<br/>differences. In MMOG space the interaction is in a virtual medium. This inter-<br/>action is “in” cyberspace. In 1990s terms, people “jack” into these virtual spaces,<br/>and they do things there. And “they” turns out to be many many people. As<br/>Edward Castronova estimates,“an absolute minimum figure would be 10 million<br/>[but my] guess is that it is perhaps 20 to 30 million” participating in these virtual<br/>worlds.3 The “[t]ypical user spends 20–30 hours per week inside the fantasy.<br/>Power users spend every available moment.”4 As one essay estimates, “assuming<br/>just average contact time among these 9.4 million people, subscribers to virtual<br/>worlds could be devoting over 213 million hours per week to build their virtual<br/>lives.”5<br/>
The things people do there are highly varied. Some play role-playing games:<br/>
working within a guild of other players to advance in status and power to some<br/>ultimate end. Some simply get together and gab: They appear (in a form they<br/>select, with qualities they choose and biographies they have written) in a virtual<br/>room and type messages to each other. Or they walk around (again, the ambigu-<br/>ity is not a slight one) and talk to people. My friend Rick does this as a cat—a<br/>male cat, he insists. As a male cat, Rick parades around this space and talks to<br/>anyone who’s interested. He aims to flush out the cat-loving sorts. The rest, he<br/>reports, he punishes.<br/>
Others do much more than gab. Some, for example, homestead. Depending<br/>
on the world and its laws, citizens are given or buy plots of undeveloped land,<br/>which they then develop. People spend extraordinary amounts of time building<br/>a life on these plots. (Isn’t it incredible the way these people waste time? While<br/>you and I spend up to seventy hours a week working for firms we don’t own and<br/>building futures we’re not sure we’ll enjoy, these people are designing and build-<br/>ing things and making a life, even if only a virtual one. Scandalous!) They build<br/>houses—by designing and then constructing them—have family or friends move<br/>in, and pursue hobbies or raise pets. They may grow trees or odd plants—like<br/>Martha’s.<br/>
MMOG space grew out of “MUD” or “MOO” space.6 MUDs and MOOs<br/>
are virtual worlds, too, but they are text-based virtual worlds. There are no real<br/>graphics in a MUD or MOO, just text, reporting what someone says and does.<br/>

four puzzles from cyberspace<br/>
13<br/>
You can construct objects in MOO space and then have them do things. But the<br/>objects act only through the mediation of text. (Their actions are generally<br/>quite simple, but even simple can be funny. One year, in a MUD that was part<br/>of a cyberlaw class, someone built a character named JPosner. If you poked<br/>JPosner, he muttered, “Poking is inefficient.” Another character was FEaster-<br/>brook. Stand in a room with FEasterbrook and use the word “fair,” and FEast-<br/>erbrook would repeat what you said, substituting the word “efficient.” “It’s not<br/>fair” became “You mean, it’s not efficient.”)<br/>
Although it was easy for people who liked texts or who wrote well to under-<br/>
stand the attraction of these text-based realities, it was not so easy for the many<br/>who didn’t have that same fondness. MMOG space lifts that limit just a bit. It is<br/>the movie version of a cyberspace novel. You build things here, and they survive<br/>your leaving. You can build a house, and people walking down the street see it.<br/>You can let them come in, and in coming into your house, they see things about<br/>you. They can see how you construct your world. If a particular MMOG space<br/>permits it, they might even see how you’ve changed the laws of the real world.<br/>In real space, for instance, people “slip and fall” on wet floors. In the MMOG<br/>space you’ve built, that “law” may not exist. Instead, in your world, wet floors<br/>may make people “slip and dance.”<br/>
The best example of this space today is the extraordinary community of<br/>
Second Life. In it, people create both things and community, the avatars are<br/>amazingly well crafted, and their owners spend hundreds of thousands of hours<br/>building things in this space that others see, and some enjoy. Some make clothes<br/>or hair styles, some make machines that make music. Whatever object or service<br/>the programming language allows, creators in Second Life are creating it. There<br/>are more than 100,000 residents of Second Life at the time of this writing. They<br/>occupy close to 2,000 servers housed in downtown San Francisco, and suck 250<br/>kilowatts of electricity just to run the computers—about the equivalent of 160<br/>homes.<br/>
But here we get back to Martha and Dank. In their exchange—when Martha<br/>
blamed Dank for having a dog that died with pain—they revealed what was<br/>most amazing about that particular MMOG. Martha’s remarks (“Why do you<br/>have a dog that suffers when dying? Get yourself a pain-free-death dog, and my<br/>petals will cause no harm”) should have struck you as odd. You may have<br/>thought,“How weird that someone would think that the fault lay not in the poi-<br/>sonous petals but in a dog that died with pain.” But in this space, Dank did have<br/>a choice about how his dog would die. Maybe not a choice about whether “poi-<br/>son” would “kill” a dog, but a choice about whether the dog would “suffer” when<br/>it “died.” He also had a choice about whether a copy of the dog could be made,<br/>so that if it died it could be “revived.” In MMOG space, these possibilities are not<br/>

For the possibilities in MMOG space are determined by the<br/>code—the software, or architecture, that makes the MMOG space what it is.<br/>“What happens when” is a statement of logic; it asserts a relationship that is<br/>manifested in code. In real space we don’t have much control over that code. In<br/>MMOG space we do.<br/>
So, when Martha said what she said about the dog, Dank made what<br/>
seemed to me an obvious response. “Why do your flowers have to stay poison-<br/>ous once they leave your land? Why not make the petals poisonous only when<br/>on your land? When they leave your land—when, for example, they are blown<br/>onto my land—why not make them harmless?”<br/>
It was an idea. But it didn’t really help. For Martha made her living selling<br/>
these poisonous plants. Others (ok not many, but some) also liked the idea of<br/>this art tied to death. So it was no solution to make poisonous plants that were<br/>poisonous only on Martha’s property, unless Martha was also interested in col-<br/>lecting a lot of very weird people on her land.<br/>
But the idea did suggest another. “Okay,” said Dank, “why not make the<br/>
petals poisonous only when in the possession of someone who has ‘purchased’<br/>them? If they are stolen, or if they blow away, then let the petals lose their poi-<br/>son. But when kept by the owner of the plant, the petals keep their poison. Isn’t<br/>that a solution to the problem that both of us face?”<br/>
The idea was ingenious. Not only did it help Dank, it helped Martha as well.<br/>
As the code existed, it allowed theft.7 (People want reality in that virtual space;<br/>there will be time enough for heaven when heaven comes.) But if Martha could<br/>modify the code slightly so that theft8 removed a plant’s poison, then “theft”<br/>would also remove the plant’s value. That change would protect the profit in<br/>her plants as well as protect Dank’s dogs. Here was a solution that made both<br/>neighbors better off—what economists call a pareto superior move. And it was<br/>a solution that was as possible as any other. All it required was a change of code.<br/>
Think for a second about what’s involved here.“Theft” entails (at minimum)<br/>
a change in possession. But in MMOG space “possession” is just a relation<br/>defined by the software that defines the space. That same code must also define<br/>the properties that possession yields. It might, like real space, distinguish between<br/>having a cake and eating it. Or it might erase that distinction, meaning you can<br/>“eat” your cake, but once it’s “eaten,” it magically reappears. In MMOG space you<br/>can feed a crowd with five loaves and two fishes, and it isn’t even a miracle.9<br/>
So why not craft the same solution to Martha and Dank’s problem? Why<br/>
not define ownership to include the quality of poisonousness, and possession<br/>without ownership to be possession without poison? If the world is designed<br/>this way, then it could resolve the dispute between Martha and Dank, not by<br/>

making one of them change his or her behavior, but by changing the laws of<br/>nature to eliminate the conflict altogether.<br/>
We’re a short way into this not so short book, though what I’m about to say<br/>
may make it a very short book indeed (for you at least). This book is all about<br/>the question raised by this simple story, and about any simplicity in this appar-<br/>ently simple answer. This is not a book about MMOG space or avatars. The<br/>story about Martha and Dank is the first and last example that will include<br/>avatars. But it is a book about cyberspace. My claim is that both “on the Inter-<br/>net” and “in cyberspace,” we will confront precisely the questions that Martha<br/>and Dank faced, as well as the questions that their solution raised. Both “on the<br/>Internet” and “in cyberspace,” technology constitutes the environment of the<br/>space, and it will give us a much wider range of control over how interactions<br/>work in that space than in real space. Problems can be programmed or “coded”<br/>into the story, and they can be “coded” away. And while the experience with<br/>gamers so far is that they don’t want virtual worlds to deviate too far from the<br/>real, the important point for now is that there is the capacity to make these<br/>worlds different. It is this capacity that raises the question that is at the core of<br/>this book: What does it mean to live in a world where problems can be coded<br/>away? And when, in that world, should we code problems away, rather than<br/>learn to work them out, or punish those who cause them?<br/>
It is not MMOG space that makes these questions interesting problems for<br/>
law; the very same problems will arise outside of MMOG space, and outside<br/>MUDs and MOOs. The problems of these spaces are problems of the Internet<br/>in general. And as more of our life becomes wired (and weird), in the sense that<br/>more of our life moves online, these questions will become more pressing.<br/>
But I have learned enough in this business to know that I can’t convince you<br/>
of this with an argument. (I’ve spent the last 12 years talking about this subject;<br/>at least I know what doesn’t work.) If you see the point, good for you. If you<br/>don’t, I must show you. So my method for readers of the second sort must be<br/>more indirect. Proof, for them, will come in a string of stories, which aim to<br/>introduce and disorient. That, again, is the purpose of this chapter.<br/>
Let me describe a few other places and the oddities that inhabit them.<br/>
GOVERNORS<br/>
A state—call it “Boral”—doesn’t like its citizens gambling, even if many of its<br/>citizens do like gambling. But the state is the boss; the people have voted; the law<br/>is as it is. Gambling in the state of Boral is illegal.<br/>
Then along comes the Internet. With the Net streaming into their homes<br/>
through phones or cable lines, some citizens of Boral decide that Internet<br/>

16<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
gambling is the next “killer app.” A citizen of Boral sets up a “server” (a com-<br/>puter that is accessible on the Internet) that provides access to online gam-<br/>bling. The state doesn’t like it. It tells this citizen, “Shut down your server or<br/>we will lock you up.”<br/>
Wise, if evasive, the gambling Boralian agrees to shut his server down—at<br/>
least in the state of Boral. But he doesn’t choose to leave the gambling business.<br/>Instead, he rents space on a server in an “offshore haven.” This offshore web<br/>server hums away, once again making gambling available on the Net and acces-<br/>sible to the people of Boral via the Internet. Here’s the important point: Given<br/>the architecture of the Internet (at least as it was circa 1999), it doesn’t really<br/>matter where in real space the server is. Access doesn’t depend on geography.<br/>Nor, depending on how clever the gambling sorts are, does access require that<br/>the user know anything about who owns, or runs, the real server. The user’s<br/>access can be passed through anonymizing sites that make it practically impos-<br/>sible in the end to know <i>what </i>went on <i>where </i>and with whom.<br/>
The Boral attorney general thus now faces a difficult problem. She may<br/>
have moved the server out of her state, but she hasn’t succeeded in reducing<br/>Boralian gambling. Before the Net, she would have had a group of people she<br/>could punish—those running gambling sites, and those who give those places<br/>custom. Now, the Net has made them potentially free from punishment—at<br/>the least because it is more difficult to know who is running the server or<br/>who is gambling. The world for this attorney general has changed. By going<br/>online, the gamblers moved into a world where this behavior is no longer<br/><i>regulable</i>.<br/>
By “regulable” I mean simply that a certain behavior is capable of regula-<br/>
tion. The term is comparative, not absolute—in some place, at some time, a cer-<br/>tain behavior will be more regulable than at another place and in another time.<br/>My claim about Boral is simply that the Net makes gambling less regulable<br/>there than it was before the Net. Or at least, in a sense that will become clearer<br/>as the story continues, with the architecture of the Net as it originally was, life<br/>on the Net is less regulable than life off the Net.<br/>
JAKE’S COMMUNITIES<br/>
If you had met Jake at a party in Ann Arbor (were Jake at a party in Ann Arbor),<br/>you would have forgotten him.10 If you didn’t forget him, you might have<br/>thought, here’s another quiet, dweeby University of Michigan undergraduate,<br/>terrified of the world, or, at least, of the people in the world.<br/>
You wouldn’t have figured Jake for an author—indeed, quite a famous<br/>
short-story author, at least within his circles. In fact, Jake is not just a famous<br/>

four puzzles from cyberspace<br/>
17<br/>
author, he was also a character in his own stories. But who he was in his stories<br/>was quite different from who he was in “real” life—if, that is, after reading his<br/>stories you still thought this distinction between “real life” and “not real life”<br/>made much sense.<br/>
Jake wrote stories about violence—about sex as well, but mainly about vio-<br/>
lence. They seethed with hatred, especially of women. It wasn’t enough to rape<br/>a woman, she had to be killed. And it wasn’t enough that she was killed, she had<br/>to be killed in a particularly painful and tortured way. This is, however unfor-<br/>tunate, a genre of writing. Jake was a master of this genre.<br/>
In real space Jake had quite successfully hidden this propensity. He was<br/>
one of a million boys: unremarkable, indistinguishable, harmless. Yet however<br/>inoffensive in real space, the harmfulness he penned in cyberspace was<br/>increasingly well known. His stories were published in USENET, in a group<br/>called alt.sex.stories.<br/>
USENET isn’t itself a network, except in the sense that the personal ads of<br/>
a national newspaper are part of a network. Strictly speaking, USENET is the<br/>product of a protocol—a set of rules named the network news transfer protocol<br/>(NNTP)—for exchanging messages intended for public viewing. These mes-<br/>sages are organized into “newsgroups,” and the newsgroups are organized into<br/>subjects. Most of the subjects are quite technical, many are related to hobbies,<br/>and some are related to sex. Some messages newsgroups come with pictures or<br/>movies, but some, like Jake’s, are simply stories.<br/>
There are thousands of newsgroups, each carrying hundreds of messages at<br/>
any one time. Anyone with access to a USENET server can get access to the<br/>messages (or at least to the ones his administrator wants him to read), and any-<br/>one with access can post a message or respond to one already posted. Imagine<br/>a public bulletin board on which people post questions or comments. Anyone<br/>can read the board and add his or her own thoughts. Now imagine 15,000<br/>boards, each with hundreds of “threads” (strings of arguments, each tied to the<br/>next). That, in any one place, is USENET. Now imagine these 15,000 boards,<br/>with hundreds of threads each, on millions of computers across the world. Post<br/>a message in one group, and it is added to that group’s board everywhere. That,<br/>for the world, is USENET.<br/>
Jake, as I said, posted to a group called alt.sex.stories. “Alt” in that name<br/>
refers to the hierarchy that the group sits within. Initially, there were seven pri-<br/>mary hierarchies.11 “Alt” was created in reaction to this initial seven: Groups<br/>are added to the seven through a formal voting process among participants in<br/>the groups. But groups are added to “alt” based solely on whether administra-<br/>tors choose to carry them, and, generally, administrators will carry them if<br/>they are popular, as long as their popularity is not controversial.<br/>

18<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Among these groups that are carried only on demand, alt.sex.stories is quite<br/>
popular. As with any writing space, if stories are “good” by the standards of the<br/>space—if they are stories that users of the space demand—they are followed<br/>and their authors become well known.<br/>
Jake’s stuff was very valuable in just this sense. His stories, about kidnap-<br/>
ping, torturing, raping, and killing women, were as graphic and repulsive as any<br/>such story could be—which is why Jake was so famous among like-minded<br/>sorts. He was a supplier to these people, a constant and consistent fix. They<br/>needed these accounts of innocent women being violated, and Jake supplied<br/>them for free.<br/>
One night in Moscow, a sixteen-year-old girl read a story by Jake. She<br/>
showed it to her father, who showed it in turn to Richard DuVal, a Michigan<br/>alum. DuVal was shocked at the story, and angry that it bore the tag<br/>“umich.edu” on the story’s header. He called his alma mater and complained.<br/>They took the complaint seriously.12<br/>
The university contacted the police; the police contacted Jake—with hand-<br/>
cuffs and a jail cell. A slew of doctors examined him. Some concluded that he<br/>was a threat. The local prosecutors agreed with these doctors, especially after his<br/>computer was seized and e-mails were discovered between Jake and a Canadian<br/>fan who was planning to re-enact in real space one of the stories Jake published<br/>in cyberspace. At least, that’s what the e-mails said. No one could tell for certain<br/>what the two men really intended. Jake said it was all pure fiction, and indeed,<br/>there was no evidence to prove otherwise.<br/>
Nonetheless, federal charges were brought against Jake for the transmission<br/>
of a threat. Jake said that his stories were only words, protected by the First<br/>Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A month and a half later, a court agreed.<br/>The charges were dropped,13 and Jake returned to the special kind of obscurity<br/>that had defined his life before.<br/>
I don’t care so much just now about whether Jake Baker’s words should<br/>
have been protected by the Constitution. My concern is Jake Baker himself, a<br/>person normed into apparent harmlessness in real space, but set free in cyber-<br/>space to become the author of this violence. People said Jake was brave, but he<br/>wasn’t “brave” in real space. He didn’t express his hatred in classes, among<br/>friends, or in the school newspaper. He slithered away to cyberspace, and only<br/>there did his deviancy flourish.<br/>
He did this because of something about him and something about cyber-<br/>
space. Jake was the sort who wanted to spread stories of violence, at least if he<br/>could do so without public account. Cyberspace gave Jake this power. Jake was<br/>in effect an author and publisher in one. He wrote stories, and as quickly as he<br/>finished them he published them—to some thirty million computers across<br/>

four puzzles from cyberspace<br/>
19<br/>
the world within a few days. His potential audience was larger than twice that<br/>for the top fifteen best-selling novels combined, and though he made nothing<br/>from his work, the demand for it was high. Jake had discovered a way to main-<br/>line his depravity into the veins of a public for whom this stuff was otherwise<br/>quite difficult to find. (Even <i>Hustler </i>wouldn’t publish the likes of this.)<br/>
Of course, there were other ways Jake could have published. He could have<br/>
offered his work to <i>Hustler, </i>or worse. But no real-world publication would have<br/>given Jake a comparable audience. Jake’s readership was potentially millions,<br/>stretching across country and continent, across culture and taste.<br/>
This reach was made possible by the power in the network: Anyone any-<br/>
where could publish to everyone everywhere. The network allowed publication<br/>without filtering, editing, or, perhaps most importantly, responsibility. One<br/>could write what one wanted, sign it or not, post it to machines across the<br/>world, and within hours the words would be everywhere. The network removed<br/>the most important constraint on speech in real space—the separation of pub-<br/>lisher from author. There is vanity publishing in real space, but only the rich can<br/>use it to reach a broad audience. For the rest of us, real space affords only the<br/>access that the publishers want to give us.<br/>
Thus cyberspace is different because of the reach it allows. But it is also<br/>
different because of the relative anonymity it permits. Cyberspace permitted<br/>Jake to escape the constraints of real space. He didn’t “go to” cyberspace when<br/>he wrote his stories, in the sense that he didn’t “leave” Ann Arbor. But when he<br/>was “in” cyberspace, it allowed him to escape the norms of Ann Arbor. He was<br/>free of real-life constraints, of the norms and understandings that had success-<br/>fully formed him into a member of a college community. Maybe he wasn’t per-<br/>fectly at home; maybe he wasn’t the happiest. But the world of the University of<br/>Michigan had succeeded in steering him away from the life of a psychopath—<br/>except when it gave him access to the Net. On the Net he was someone else.<br/>
As the Internet has grown, it has produced many more opportunities for<br/>
Jake-like characters—characters that do things in the virtual world that they<br/>would never do in the real world. One of the most popular MMOGs is a<br/>game called “Grand Theft Auto.” In this game, one practices committing<br/>crimes. And one of the most troubling uses of video chat is the practice of vir-<br/>tual-prostitution by children. As the <i>New York Times </i>recently reported, thou-<br/>sands of children spend hundreds of hours prostituting themselves online.<br/>Sitting in the “privacy” of their own bedroom, using the iSight camera their<br/>parents gave them for Christmas, a 13-year-old girl or boy enacts the sexual<br/>behavior demanded by the audience. The audience gets their fix of sexual<br/>perversion. The kid gets money, and whatever psychological baggage this<br/>behavior creates.14<br/>

20<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
It is impossibly difficult to look across this range of Jake-like characters<br/>
and not think that, at some point, the virtual has crossed over into something<br/>real. Or, at least, the virtual has real effects—either on those who live it, or on<br/>those who live with them.15 When Jake was prosecuted, many First Amendment<br/>defenders argued his words, however vivid, never crossed into reality. And no<br/>doubt, there is a difference between writing about rape and raping, just as there<br/>is a difference between an actor enacting rape and actually raping someone.<br/>But I take it that all concede a line is crossed somewhere as we move across this<br/>range of Jake-like characters. If a parent was untroubled by the virtual prostitu-<br/>tion of her son in his bedroom, we would not understand that to be principled<br/>free speech activism, even if the only “prostitution” was the son describing in<br/>text how he was molested by those in the chat.<br/>
But my point is not to draw lines between the acceptable virtual dual-lives<br/>
and the unacceptable. It is instead to remark that this space enables more of this<br/>duality. And though part of this duality is always “only virtual,” and sometimes<br/>“only words,” real-space regulators (whether parents or governments) will feel<br/>compelled to react. The Net enables lives that were previously impossible, or<br/>inconvenient, or uncommon. At least some of those virtual lives will have effects<br/>on non-virtual lives—both the lives of the people living in the virtual space, and<br/>the lives of those around them.<br/>
WORMS THAT SNIFF<br/>
A “worm” is a bit of computer code that is spit out on the Net and works its way<br/>into the systems of vulnerable computers. It is not a “virus” because it doesn’t<br/>attach itself to other programs and interfere with their operation. It is just a bit<br/>of extra code that does what the code writer says. The code could be harmless<br/>and simply sit on someone’s machine. Or it could be harmful and corrupt files<br/>or do other damage that its author commands.<br/>
Imagine a worm designed to do good (at least in the minds of some).<br/>
Imagine that the code writer is the FBI and that the FBI is looking for a partic-<br/>ular document belonging to the National Security Agency (NSA). Suppose<br/>that this document is classified and illegal to possess without the proper clear-<br/>ance. Imagine that the worm propagates itself on the Net, finding its way onto<br/>hard disks wherever it can. Once on a computer’s hard disk, it scans the entire<br/>disk. If it finds the NSA document, it sends a message back to the FBI saying as<br/>much. If it doesn’t, it erases itself. Finally, assume that it can do all this without<br/>“interfering” with the operation of the machine. No one would know it was<br/>there; it would report back nothing except that the NSA document was on the<br/>hard disk.<br/>

four puzzles from cyberspace<br/>
21<br/>
Is this an unconstitutional worm? This is a hard question that at first seems<br/>
to have an easy answer. The worm is engaging in a government-initiated search<br/>of citizens’ disks. There is no reasonable suspicion (as the law ordinarily<br/>requires) that the disk holds the document for which the government is search-<br/>ing. It is a generalized, suspicionless search of private spaces by the govern-<br/>ment.<br/>
From the standpoint of the Constitution—the Fourth Amendment in par-<br/>
ticular—you don’t get any worse than that. The Fourth Amendment was writ-<br/>ten against the background of just this sort of abuse. Kings George II and<br/>George III would give officers a “general warrant” authorizing them to search<br/>through private homes looking for evidence of a crime.16 No suspicion was<br/>needed before the officer ransacked your house, but because he had a warrant,<br/>you were not able to sue the officer for trespass. The aim of the Fourth Amend-<br/>ment was to require at least suspicion, so that the burden of the search fell on a<br/>reasonably chosen class.17<br/>
But is the worm really the same as the King’s general search? One important<br/>
difference is this: Unlike the victims of the general searches that the Framers of<br/>our Constitution were concerned about, the computer user never knows that his<br/>or her disk is being searched by the worm. With the general search, the police<br/>were breaking into a house and rummaging through private stuff. With the<br/>worm, it is a bit of computer code that does the breaking, and (I’ve assumed) it<br/>can “see” only one thing. And perhaps more importantly, unlike the general<br/>search, the worm learns little and leaves no damage after it’s finished: The code<br/>can’t read private letters; it doesn’t break down doors; it doesn’t interfere with<br/>ordinary life. And the innocent have nothing to fear.<br/>
The worm is silent in a way that King George’s troops were not. It searches<br/>
perfectly and invisibly, discovering only the guilty. It does not burden the inno-<br/>cent; it does not trouble the ordinary citizen; it captures only what is outside the<br/>protection of the law.<br/>
This difference complicates the constitutional question. The worm’s behav-<br/>
ior is like a generalized search in that it is a search without suspicion. But it is<br/>unlike the historical generalized search in that it creates no disruption of ordi-<br/>nary life and “discovers” only contraband. In this way, the worm is like a dog<br/>sniff—which at least at airports is constitutionally permissible without probable<br/>cause18—but better. Unlike the dog sniff, the worm doesn’t even let the com-<br/>puter user know when there is a search (and hence the user suffers no particu-<br/>larized anxiety).<br/>
Is the worm, then, constitutional? That depends on your conception of<br/>
what the Fourth Amendment protects. In one view, the amendment protects<br/>against suspicionless governmental invasions, whether those invasions are bur-<br/>

22<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
densome or not. In a second view, the amendment protects against invasions<br/>that are burdensome, allowing only those for which there is adequate suspicion<br/>that guilt will be uncovered. The paradigm case that motivated the framers<br/>does not distinguish between these two very different types of protections,<br/>because the technology of the time wouldn’t distinguish either. You couldn’t—<br/>technically—have a perfectly burdenless generalized search in 1791. So they<br/>didn’t—technically—express a view about whether such a search should be<br/>constitutionally proscribed. It is instead we who must choose what the amend-<br/>ment is to mean.<br/>
Let’s take the example one step further. Imagine that the worm does not<br/>
search every machine it encounters, but instead can be put on a machine only<br/>with judicial authorization—say, a warrant. Now the suspicionless-search part<br/>of the problem has been removed. But now imagine a second part to this rule:<br/>The government requires that networks be constructed so that a worm, with<br/>judicial authorization, could be placed on any machine. Machines in this<br/>regime, in other words, must be made worm-ready, even though worms will be<br/>deployed only with judicial warrant.<br/>
Is there any constitutional problem with this? I explore this question in<br/>
much greater detail in Chapter 11, but for now, notice its salient feature. In<br/>both cases, we are describing a regime that allows the government to collect data<br/>about us in a highly efficient manner—inexpensively, that is, for both the gov-<br/>ernment and the innocent. This efficiency is made possible by technology,<br/>which permits searches that before would have been far too burdensome and<br/>invasive. In both cases, then, the question comes to this: When the ability to<br/>search without burden increases, does the government’s power to search<br/>increase as well? Or, more darkly, as James Boyle puts it: “Is freedom inversely<br/>related to the efficiency of the available means of surveillance?” For if it is, as<br/>Boyle puts it, then “we have much to fear.”19<br/>
This question, of course, is not limited to the government. One of the defin-<br/>
ing features of modern life is the emergence of technologies that make data<br/>collection and processing extraordinarily efficient. Most of what we do—hence,<br/>most of what we are—is recorded outside our homes. When you make tele-<br/>phone calls, data are recorded about whom you called, when, how long you<br/>spoke, and how frequently you made such calls.20 When you use your credit<br/>cards, data are recorded about when, where, what, and from whom you made<br/>purchases. When you take a flight, your itinerary is recorded and possibly pro-<br/>filed by the government to determine whether you are likely to be a terrorist.21<br/>If you drive a car in London, cameras record your license plate to determine<br/>whether you’ve paid the proper “congestion tax.” No doubt Hollywood’s image<br/>of counter-terrorist units—where one person sitting behind a terminal instantly<br/>

tracks the life of another—is wrong. But it need not be terribly wrong for much<br/>longer. It may not be easy to imagine systems that follow an individual wherever<br/>he goes, but it is easy to imagine technologies that gather an extraordinary<br/>amount of data about everything we do and make those data accessible to those<br/>with the proper authorization. The intrusiveness would be slight, and the payoff<br/>could be great.<br/>
Both private and public monitoring in the digital age, then, have the same<br/>
salient feature: monitoring, or searching, can increase without increasing the<br/>burden on the individual searched. Both present a similar question: How should<br/>we think about this change? How should the protection the framers gave us be<br/>applied to a world the framers couldn’t even imagine?<br/>
THEMES<br/>
Four stories, four themes, each a window into one aspect of cyberspace that will<br/>be central in all that follows. My aim in the balance of this book is to work<br/>through the issues raised by these four themes. I thus end this chapter with a<br/>map of the four, laid out in the order they will appear in the balance of the book.<br/>That order begins with story number two.<br/>
Regulability<br/>
“Regulability” is the capacity of a government to regulate behavior within its<br/>proper reach. In the context of the Internet, that means the ability of the govern-<br/>ment to regulate the behavior of (at least) its citizens while on the Net. The<br/>story about Boral was thus a story about regulability, or more specifically, about<br/>the changes in regulability that cyberspace brings. Before the Internet, it was rel-<br/>atively easy for the attorney general of Boral to control commercial gambling<br/>within her jurisdiction; after the Internet, when the servers moved outside of<br/>Boral, regulation became much more difficult.<br/>
For the regulator, this is just a particular instance of a much more general<br/>
story. To regulate well, you need to know (1) who someone is, (2) where they<br/>are, and (3) what they’re doing. But because of the way the Internet was origi-<br/>nally designed (and more on this below), there was no simple way to know (1)<br/>who someone is, (2) where they are, and (3) what they’re doing. Thus, as life<br/>moved onto (this version of) the Internet, the regulability of that life decreased.<br/>The architecture of the space—at least as it was—rendered life in this space<br/>less regulable.<br/>
The balance of Part I is about regulability. Can we imagine a more regulable<br/>
cyberspace? Is this the cyberspace we are coming to know?<br/>

24<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Regulation by Code<br/>
The story about Martha and Dank is a clue to answering this question about<br/>regulability. If in MMOG space we can change the laws of nature—make pos-<br/>sible what before was impossible, or make impossible what before was possi-<br/>ble—why can’t we change regulability in cyberspace? Why can’t we imagine an<br/>Internet or a cyberspace where behavior can be controlled because code now<br/>enables that control?<br/>
For this, importantly, is just what MMOG space is. MMOG space is “reg-<br/>
ulated,” though the regulation is special. In MMOG space regulation comes<br/>through code. Important rules are imposed, not through social sanctions,<br/>and not by the state, but by the very architecture of the particular space. A<br/>rule is defined, not through a statute, but through the code that governs the<br/>space.<br/>
This is the second theme of this book: There is regulation of behavior on<br/>
the Internet and in cyberspace, but that regulation is imposed primarily<br/>through code. The differences in the regulations effected through code distin-<br/>guish different parts of the Internet and cyberspace. In some places, life is fairly<br/>free; in other places, it is more controlled. And the difference between these<br/>spaces is simply a difference in the architectures of control—that is, a difference<br/>in code.<br/>
If we combine the first two themes, then, we come to a central argument<br/>
of the book: The regulability described in the first theme depends on the code<br/>described in the second. Some architectures of cyberspace are more regulable<br/>than others; some architectures enable better control than others. Therefore,<br/>whether a part of cyberspace—or the Internet generally—can be regulated<br/>turns on the nature of its code. Its architecture will affect whether behavior<br/>can be controlled. To follow Mitch Kapor, its architecture is its politics.22<br/>
And from this a further point follows: If some architectures are more<br/>
regulable than others—if some give governments more control than others—<br/>then governments will favor some architectures more than others. Favor, in<br/>turn, can translate into action, either by governments, or for governments.<br/>Either way, the architectures that render space less regulable can themselves be<br/>changed to make the space more regulable. (By whom, and why, is a matter we<br/>take up later.)<br/>
This fact about regulability is a threat to those who worry about govern-<br/>
mental power; it is a reality for those who depend upon governmental power.<br/>Some designs enable government more than others; some designs enable gov-<br/>ernment differently; some designs should be chosen over others, depending<br/>upon the values at stake.<br/>

four puzzles from cyberspace<br/>
25<br/>
Latent Ambiguity<br/>
The worm tells a different story still. Though it is a technology for searching, the<br/>worm’s function differs from “searching” in real space. In real space, a search car-<br/>ries costs: the burdens of the search, the insecurities it might create, the exposure<br/>it might make possible to invasions beyond a legitimate reach.23 The worm<br/>erases those costs: The burden is gone, the search is (practically) invisible, and<br/>the searching technology is programmed to find only what is illegal. This raises<br/>a question about how such a search should, under the Constitution, be under-<br/>stood.<br/>
A fair view of the Constitution’s protections could go in either of two ways.<br/>
It may be that we see the worm’s invasion as inconsistent with the dignity that<br/>the amendment was written to protect,24 or it may be that we see the invasion<br/>of the worm as so unobtrusive as to be reasonable. The answer could be either,<br/>which means that the change reveals what I will call “a latent ambiguity” in the<br/>original constitutional rule. In the original context, the rule was clear (no gen-<br/>eralized search), but in the current context, the rule depends upon which value<br/>the Constitution was meant to protect. The question is now ambiguous between<br/>(at least) two different answers. Either answer is possible, depending upon the<br/>value, so now we must choose one or the other.<br/>
You may not buy my story about the worm. You may think it is pure science<br/>
fiction. But by the end of the book, I will convince you that there are any num-<br/>ber of cases in which a similar ambiguity troubles our constitutional past. In<br/>many of them our Constitution yields no answer to the question of how it<br/>should be applied, because at least two answers are possible—in light of the<br/>choices that the framers actually made and given the technologies of today.<br/>
For Americans, this ambiguity creates a problem. If we lived in an era when<br/>
courts felt entitled to select the value that produced an answer that made the<br/>most sense in the context, there would be no problem. Latent ambiguities would<br/>be answered by choices made by judges—the framers could have gone either<br/>way, but our judges choose to go <i>this </i>way.<br/>
But we don’t live in such an era, and so we don’t have a way for courts to<br/>
resolve these ambiguities. As a result, we must rely on other institutions. My<br/>claim is a dark one: We have no such institutions. If our ways don’t change, our<br/>constitution in cyberspace will be a thinner and thinner regime.<br/>
Cyberspace will present us with ambiguities over and over again. It will<br/>
press this question of how best to go on. We have tools from real space that will<br/>help resolve the interpretive questions by pointing us in one direction or<br/>another, at least some of the time. But in the end the tools will guide us even less<br/>than they do in real space and time. When the gap between their guidance and<br/>

26<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
what we do becomes obvious, we will be forced to do something we’re not very<br/>good at doing—deciding what we want, and what is right.<br/>
Competing Sovereigns<br/>
But regulation by whom? For the rules are different in one place versus another.<br/>
This was one important issue raised by Jake Baker. Jake lived in Ann<br/>
Arbor, Michigan. His life there was subject to the norms of Ann Arbor, and he<br/>apparently adapted to these norms reasonably well. The authority of that<br/>space governed Jake, and, as far as anyone knew, it appeared to govern him<br/>exclusively.<br/>
But in cyberspace, Jake’s behavior changed, in part because the norms of<br/>
the space were different. That created the problem. For when Jake “went to”<br/>cyberspace, he didn’t leave real space. In particular, he never left Ann Arbor.<br/>While sitting in a dorm at the University of Michigan, he was able to teleport<br/>himself—in the only normatively significant sense—to a different world<br/>where the norms of civility and decency that governed outside his dorm room<br/>did not reign. Cyberspace gave Jake the chance to escape Ann Arbor norms<br/>and to live according to the norms of another place. It created a competing<br/>authority for Jake and gave him the chance to select between these competing<br/>authorities merely by switching his computer on or off.<br/>
Again, my point is not that no similar possibility exists in real space—it<br/>
plainly does. There is no doubt a Jake living in Hackensack, New Jersey (a sub-<br/>urban town with suburban values), who drives every night into lower Man-<br/>hattan and lives for a few hours according to the “rules” of lower Manhattan.<br/>Those rules are not the rules of Hackensack; that life is different. Like Ann<br/>Arbor Jake, the Hackensack Jake lives under competing authorities. But<br/>between the lives of these two Jakes, there is a difference in degree that ripens<br/>into a difference in kind: It is at least conceivable that the Ann Arbor Jake<br/>raises a more significant problem for Ann Arbor than the Hackensack Jake<br/>raises for Hackensack. The differences could well be greater, and the effect<br/>more pervasive.<br/>
Nor should we think too narrowly about the competing normative com-<br/>
munities into which a Jake might move. “Escape” here can be good or bad. It<br/>is escape when a gay teen in an intolerant small town can leave the norms of<br/>that town through a gay chat room on America Online;25 it is escape when a<br/>child predator escapes the norms of ordinary society and engages a child in<br/>online sex.26 Both escapes are enabled by the architecture of cyberspace as we<br/>now know it. Our attitudes about each, however, are very different. I call the<br/>first escape liberating and the second criminal. There are some who would call<br/>

four puzzles from cyberspace<br/>
27<br/>
both escapes criminal, and some who would call both liberating. But the<br/>question isn’t about name-calling, it’s about the consequences of living in a<br/>world where we can occupy both sorts of space at the same time. When 50<br/>people from 25 jurisdictions around the world spend 2,000 hours building a<br/>virtual community in Second Life that is housed on servers in San Francisco,<br/>what claim should real world jurisdictions have over that activity? Which of<br/>the 25 jurisdictions matters most? Which sovereign should govern?<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
These four themes frame everything that follows. They also map the under-<br/>standing that I want this book to provide. Regulation in cyberspace can<br/>help us see something important about how all regulation works. That’s<br/>the lesson of the first theme, “regulability.” It will also introduce a regulator<br/>(“code”) whose significance we don’t yet fully understand. That’s the second<br/>theme, “Regulation by Code.” That regulation will render ambiguous certain<br/>values that are fundamental to our tradition. Thus, the third theme,“latent<br/>ambiguity.” That ambiguity will require us, the United States, to make a<br/>choice. But this choice is just one among many that many sovereigns will<br/>have to make. In the end the hardest problem will be to reckon these “com-<br/>peting sovereigns,” as they each act to mark this space with their own dis-<br/>tinctive values.<br/>
I explore these four themes against a background that, as I said at the<br/>
start, has changed significantly since the first edition of this book. When I first<br/>wrote the book, two ideas seemed to dominate debate about the Net: first, that<br/>the government could never regulate the Net, and second, that this was a<br/>good thing. Today, attitudes are different. There is still the commonplace that<br/>government can’t regulate, but in a world drowning in spam, computer<br/>viruses, identity theft, copyright “piracy,” and the sexual exploitation of chil-<br/>dren, the resolve against regulation has weakened. We all love the Net. But if<br/>some government could really deliver on the promise to erase all the bads of<br/>this space, most of us would gladly sign up.<br/>
Yet while attitudes about the Net have progressed, my own views have<br/>
not. I still believe the Net can be regulated. I still believe that the obvious<br/>consequence of obvious influences will be to radically increase the ability of<br/>governments to regulate this Net. I also still believe that, in principle, this is<br/>not a bad thing. I am not against regulation, properly done. I believe regula-<br/>tion is essential to preserving and defending certain fundamental liberties.<br/>But I also still believe that we are far from a time when our government in<br/>particular can properly regulate in this context. This is both because of a<br/>general skepticism about government—grounded in a disgust about the par-<br/>ticular form of corruption that defines how our government functions—and<br/>

28<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
a particular skepticism about government—that it has not yet fully recog-<br/>nized just how regulation in the digital age works.<br/>
No doubt this particular mix of views will continue to puzzle some. How<br/>
can I believe in regulation and yet be so skeptical about government? But it<br/>doesn’t take much imagination to understand how these apparently conflict-<br/>ing views can go together. I take it we all believe in the potential of medicine.<br/>But imagine your attitude if you were confronted with a “doctor” carrying a<br/>vial of leeches. There’s much we could do in this context, or at least, that is my<br/>view. But there’s a very good reason not to want to do anything with this par-<br/>ticular doctor.<br/>

It is said that cyberspace can’t be regulated. But what does it mean to say that<br/>something could be regulated? What makes regulation possible? That’s the<br/>question raised in this Part. If the Internet can’t be regulated, why? And what-<br/>ever the reason, can it change? Might an unregulable space be tamed? Might<br/>the Wild West be won, and how?<br/>

<i>The rise of an electronic medium that disregards geographical bound-<br/>aries throws the law into disarray by creating entirely new phenomena<br/>that need to become the subject of clear legal rules but that cannot be<br/>governed, satisfactorily, by any current territorially based sovereign.</i><br/>

IF THERE WAS A MEME THAT RULED TALK ABOUT CYBERSPACE, IT WAS THAT CYBERSPACE<br/>was a place that could not be regulated. That it “cannot be governed”; that its<br/>“nature” is to resist regulation. Not that cyberspace cannot be broken, or that<br/>government cannot shut it down. But if cyberspace exists, so first-generation<br/>thinking goes, government’s power over behavior there is quite limited. In its<br/>essence, cyberspace is a space of no control.<br/>
Nature. Essence. Innate. The way things are. This kind of rhetoric should<br/>
raise suspicions in any context. It should especially raise suspicion here. If<br/>there is any place where nature has no rule, it is in cyberspace. If there is any<br/>place that is constructed, cyberspace is it. Yet the rhetoric of “essence” hides<br/>this constructedness. It misleads our intuitions in dangerous ways.<br/>
31<br/>

32<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
This is the fallacy of “is-ism”—the mistake of confusing how some-<br/>
thing is with how it must be. There is certainly a way that cyberspace <i>is</i>. But<br/>how cyberspace <i>is </i>is not how cyberspace has to be. There is no single way<br/>that the Net has to be; no single architecture that defines the nature of the<br/>Net. The possible architectures of something that we would call “the Net”<br/>are many, and the character of life within those different architectures is<br/>diverse.<br/>
That most of us commit this fallacy is not surprising. Most of us<br/>
haven’t a clue about how networks work. We therefore have no clue about<br/>how they could be different. We assume that the way we find things is the<br/>way things have to be. We are not trained to think about all the different<br/>ways technology could achieve the same ends through different means.<br/>That sort of training is what technologists get. Most of us are not technol-<br/>ogists.<br/>
But underlying everything in this book is a single normative plea: that<br/>
all of us must learn at least enough to see that technology is plastic. It can<br/>be remade to do things differently. And that if there is a mistake that we<br/>who know too little about technology should make, it is the mistake of<br/>imagining technology to be too plastic, rather than not plastic enough. We<br/>should expect—and demand—that it can be made to reflect any set of val-<br/>ues that we think important. The burden should be on the technologists to<br/>show us why that demand can’t be met.<br/>
The particular is-ism that I begin with here is the claim that cyberspace<br/>
can’t be regulated. As this, and the following chapters argue, that view is<br/>wrong. Whether cyberspace can be regulated depends upon its architecture.<br/>The original architecture of the Internet made regulation extremely diffi-<br/>cult. But that original architecture can change. And there is all the evidence<br/>in the world that it is changing. Indeed, under the architecture that I<br/>believe will emerge, cyberspace will be the most regulable space humans<br/>have ever known. The “nature” of the Net might once have been its unreg-<br/>ulability; that “nature” is about to flip.<br/>
To see the flip, you must first see a contrast between two different<br/>
cyber-places. These two cyber-places are ideal types, and, indeed, one of the<br/>two ideals no longer exists anywhere on the Net. That fact is confirmation<br/>of the point this section aims to make: that we’re moving from one Internet<br/>to another, and the one we’re moving to will be significantly more regula-<br/>ble.<br/>
The following descriptions are not technical; I don’t offer them as com-<br/>
plete definitions of types of networks or types of control. I offer them to<br/>illustrate—to sketch enough to see a far more general point.<br/>

CYBER-PLACES: HARVARD VERSUS CHICAGO<br/>
The Internet was born at universities in the United States. Its first subscribers<br/>were researchers. But as a form of life, its birth was tied to university life. It<br/>swept students online, pulling them away from life in real space. The Net was<br/>one of many intoxicants on college campuses in the mid-1990s, and its signif-<br/>icance only grew through time. As former <i>New York Times </i>columnist J. C.<br/>Herz wrote in her first book about cyberspace:<br/>
When I look up, it’s four-thirty in the morning. “No way.” I look from the clock to my<br/>
watch. Way. I’ve been in front of this screen for six hours, and it seems like no time<br/>
at all. I’m not even remotely tired. Dazed and thirsty, but not tired. In fact, I’m<br/>
euphoric. I stuff a disheveled heap of textbooks, photocopied articles, hilighters and<br/>
notes into my backpack and run like a madwoman up the concrete steps, past the<br/>
security guard, and outside into the predawn mist. . . .<br/>
I stop where a wet walkway meets a dry one and stand for a sec. . . . [I] start<br/>
thinking about this thing that buzzes around the entire world, through the phone<br/>
lines, all day and all night long. It’s right under our noses and it’s invisible. It’s like<br/>
Narnia, or Magritte, or <i>Star Trek, </i>an entire goddamned world. Except it doesn’t phys-<br/>
ically exist. It’s just the collective consciousness of however many people are on it.<br/>
This really is outstandingly weird.3<br/>
Yet not all universities adopted the Net in the same way. Or put differently,<br/>
the access universities granted was not all the same. The rules were different.<br/>The freedoms allowed were different. One example of this difference comes<br/>from two places I knew quite well, though many other examples could make<br/>the same point.<br/>
In the middle 1990s at the University of Chicago, if you wanted access to<br/>
the Internet, you simply connected your machine to Ethernet jacks located<br/>throughout the university.4 Any machine with an Ethernet connection could<br/>be plugged into these jacks. Once connected, your machine had full access to<br/>the Internet—access, that is, that was complete, anonymous, and free.<br/>
The reason for this freedom was a decision by an administrator—the<br/>
then-Provost, Geoffrey Stone, a former dean of the law school and a promi-<br/>nent free speech scholar. When the university was designing its net, the tech-<br/>nicians asked Stone whether anonymous communication should be<br/>permitted. Stone, citing the principle that the rules regulating speech at the<br/>university should be as protective of free speech as the First Amendment, said<br/>yes: People should have the right to communicate at the university anony-<br/>mously, because the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the<br/>

34<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
same right vis-à-vis governments. From that policy decision flowed the archi-<br/>tecture of the University of Chicago’s net.<br/>
At Harvard, the rules are different. If you plug your machine into an Eth-<br/>
ernet jack at the Harvard Law School, you will not gain access to the Net. You<br/>cannot connect your machine to the Net at Harvard unless the machine is<br/>registered—licensed, approved, verified. Only members of the university<br/>community can register their machines. Once registered, all interactions with<br/>the network are monitored and identified to a particular machine. To join the<br/>network, users have to “sign” a user agreement. The agreement acknowledges<br/>this pervasive practice of monitoring. Anonymous speech on this network is<br/>not permitted—it is against the rules. Access can be controlled based on who<br/>you are, and interactions can be traced based on what you did.<br/>
This design also arose from the decision of an administrator, one less<br/>
focused on the protections of the First Amendment. Control was the ideal at<br/>Harvard; access was the ideal at Chicago. Harvard chose technologies that<br/>made control possible; Chicago chose technologies that made access easy.<br/>
These two networks differ in at least two important ways. First and most<br/>
obviously, they differ in the values they embrace.5 That difference is by design.<br/>At the University of Chicago, First Amendment values determined network<br/>design; different values determined Harvard’s design.<br/>
But they differ in a second way as well. Because access is controlled at Har-<br/>
vard and identity is known, actions can be traced back to their root in the net-<br/>work. Because access is not controlled at Chicago, and identity is not known,<br/>actions cannot be traced back to their root in the network. Monitoring or<br/>tracking behavior at Chicago is harder than it is at Harvard. Behavior in the<br/>Harvard network is more controllable than in the University of Chicago net-<br/>work.<br/>
The networks thus differ in the extent to which they make behavior<br/>
within each network regulable. This difference is simply a matter of code—a<br/>difference in the software and hardware that grants users access. Different<br/>code makes differently regulable networks. Regulability is thus a function of<br/>design.<br/>
These two networks are just two points on a spectrum of possible net-<br/>
work designs. At one extreme we might place the Internet—a network defined<br/>by a suite of protocols that are open and nonproprietary and that require no<br/>personal identification to be accessed and used. At the other extreme are tra-<br/>ditional closed, proprietary networks, which grant access only to those with<br/>express authorization; control, therefore, is tight. In between are networks<br/>that mix elements of both. These mixed networks add a layer of control to the<br/>otherwise uncontrolled Internet. They layer elements of control on top.<br/>

is-ism<br/>
35<br/>
Thus the original—there have been some changes in the last years6—<br/>
University of Chicago network was close to the norm for Internet access in the<br/>middle of the 1990s.7 Let’s call it Net95. At the other extreme are closed net-<br/>works that both predate the Internet and still exist today—for example, the<br/>ATM network, which makes it possible to get cash from your California bank<br/>at 2:00 A.M. while in Tblisi. And in the middle are Harvard-type networks—<br/>networks that add a layer of control on top of the suite of protocols that<br/>define “the Internet.” These protocols are called “TCP/IP.” I describe them<br/>more extensively in Chapter 4. But the essential feature of the Harvard net-<br/>work is that this suite was supplemented. You get access to the Internet only<br/>after you’ve passed through this layer of control.<br/>
All three designs are communication networks that are “like” the Internet.<br/>
But their differences raise an obvious question: When people say that the<br/>Internet is “unregulable,” which network are they describing? And if they’re<br/>talking about an unregulable network, why is it unregulable? What features in<br/>its design make it unregulable? And could those features be different?<br/>
Consider three aspects of Net95’s design that make it hard for a regulator<br/>
to control behavior there. From the perspective of an anonymity-loving user,<br/>these are “features” of Net95—aspects that make that network more valuable.<br/>But from the perspective of the regulator, these features are “bugs”—imper-<br/>fections that limit the data that the Net collects, either about the user or about<br/>the material he or she is using.<br/>
The first imperfection is information about users—who the someone is<br/>
who is using the Internet. In the words of the famous <i>New Yorker </i>cartoon of<br/>two dogs sitting in front of a PC, “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a<br/>dog.”8 No one knows, because the Internet protocols don’t require that you<br/>credential who you are before you use the Internet. Again, the <i>Internet </i>proto-<br/>col doesn’t require that credential; your local access point, like the Harvard<br/>network, might. But even then, the information that ties the individual to a<br/>certain network transaction is held by the access provider. It is not a part of<br/>your Internet transaction.<br/>
The second “imperfection” is information about geography—where the<br/>
someone is who is using the Internet. As I will describe more in Chapter 4,<br/>although the Internet is constituted by addresses, those addresses were initially<br/>simply logical addresses. They didn’t map to any particular location in the<br/>physical world. Thus, when I receive a packet of data sent by you through the<br/>Internet, it is certainly possible for me to know the Internet address from<br/>which your packet comes, but I will not know the physical address.<br/>
And finally, the third “imperfection” is information about use—what is<br/>
the data being sent across this network; what is its use? The Internet does not<br/>

36<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
require any particular labeling system for data being sent across the Internet.<br/>Again, as we’ll see in more detail below, there are norms that say something,<br/>but no rule to assure data gets distributed just according to the norms. Noth-<br/>ing puts the bits into a context of meaning, at least not in a way that a machine<br/>can use. Net95 had no requirement that data be labeled. “Packets” of data are<br/>labeled, in the sense of having an address. But beyond that, the packets could<br/>contain anything at all.<br/>
These three “imperfections” tie together: Because there is no simple way<br/>
to know who someone is, where they come from, and what they’re doing,<br/>there is no simple way to regulate how people behave on the Net. If you can’t<br/>discover who did what and where, you can’t easily impose rules that say “don’t<br/>do this, or at least, don’t do it there.” Put differently, what you can’t know<br/>determines what you can control.<br/>
Consider an example to make the point clearer. Let’s say the state of Penn-<br/>
sylvania wants to block kids from porn. It thus passes a rule that says “No kid<br/>in Pennsylvania can get access to porn.” To enforce that rule, Pennsylvania has<br/>got to know (1) whether someone is a kid, (2) where they come from (i.e.,<br/>Pennsylvania or Maine), and (3) what they’re looking at (porn or marzipan).<br/>Net95, however, won’t be of much help to Pennsylvania as it tries to enforce<br/>this rule. People accessing content in Pennsylvania using Net95 need not<br/>reveal anything about who they are or where they come from, and nothing in<br/>the design of Net95 requires sites to describe what content they carry. These<br/>gaps in data make regulating hard. Thus from the perspective of the regulator,<br/>these are imperfections in the Net’s original design.<br/>
But the Harvard network suggests that it is at least possible for the “bugs”<br/>
in Net95 to be eliminated. The Net could know the credentials of the user<br/>(identity and location) and the nature of the data being sent. That knowledge<br/>could be layered onto the Internet without destroying its functionality. The<br/>choice, in other words, is not between the Internet and no Internet, or<br/>between the Internet and a closed proprietary network. Harvard suggests a<br/>middle way. Architectures of control could be layered on top of the Net to<br/>“correct” or eliminate “imperfections.” And these architectures could, in other<br/>words, facilitate control.9<br/>
That is the first, very small, claim of this early chapter in a story about<br/>
emerging control: Architectures of control are possible; they could be added<br/>to the Internet that we already know. If they were added, that would radically<br/>change the character of the network. Whether these architectures should be<br/>added depends upon what we want to use the network for.<br/>
I say this is a small claim because, while it is important, it is the sort of<br/>
point that one recognizes as obvious even if one didn’t see it originally. More<br/>

is-ism<br/>
37<br/>
than obvious, the point should be pedestrian. We see it in lots of contexts.<br/>Think, for example, of the post office. When I was growing up, the Post Office<br/>was a haven for anonymous speech. The job of the Post Office was simply to<br/>deliver packages. Like Net95, it didn’t worry about who a piece of mail was<br/>from, or what was in the envelope or package. There was no enforced require-<br/>ment that you register before you send a letter. There was no enforced require-<br/>ment that the letter have a return address or that the return address be correct.<br/>If you were careful to avoid fingerprints, you could use this government-<br/>subsidized facility to send perfectly anonymous messages.<br/>
Obviously, the Post Office could be architected differently. The service<br/>
could require, for example, a return address. It could require that you verify<br/>that the return address was correct (for example, by checking your ID before<br/>it accepted a package). It could even require inspection before it shipped a<br/>particular package or envelope. All of these changes in the procedures for the<br/>post would produce a world in which mail was more easily monitored and<br/>tracked. The government makes that choice when it designs the Post Office as<br/>it does. If monitoring becomes important, the government can change the<br/>system to facilitate it. If not, they can leave the postal system as it (largely) is.<br/>But if it does change the system to make monitoring more simple, that will<br/>reflect changes in values that inform the design of that network.<br/>
The claim of this book is that there are sufficient interests to move the<br/>
Net95 from a default of anonymity to a default of identification. But nothing<br/>I’ve said yet shows how. What would get us from the relatively unregulable lib-<br/>ertarian Net to a highly regulable Net of control?<br/>
This is the question for the balance of Part I. I move in two steps. In<br/>
Chapter 4, my claim is that even without the government’s help, we will see<br/>the Net move to an architecture of control. In Chapter 5, I sketch how govern-<br/>ment might help. The trends promise a highly regulable Net—not the liber-<br/>tarian’s utopia, not the Net your father (or more likely your daughter or son)<br/>knew, but a Net whose essence is the character of control.<br/>
An Internet, in other words, that flips the Internet as it was.<br/>

THE INVISIBLE MAN DOESN’T FEAR THE STATE. HE KNOWS HIS NATURE PUTS HIM<br/>beyond its reach (unless he gets stupid, and of course, he always gets stupid).<br/>His story is the key to a general lesson: If you can’t know who someone is, or<br/>where he is, or what he’s doing, you can’t regulate him. His behavior is as he<br/>wants it to be. There’s little the state can do to change it.<br/>
So too with the original Internet: Everyone was an invisible man. As<br/>
cyberspace was originally architected, there was no simple way to know who<br/>someone was, where he was, or what he was doing. As the Internet was orig-<br/>inally architected, then, there was no simple way to regulate behavior there.<br/>
The aim of the last chapter, however, was to add a small but important<br/>
point to this obvious idea: Whatever cyberspace was, there’s no reason it has<br/>to stay this way. The “nature” of the Internet is not God’s will. Its nature is<br/>simply the product of its design. That design could be different. The Net<br/>could be designed to reveal who someone is, where they are, and what<br/>they’re doing. And if it were so designed, then the Net could become, as I<br/>will argue throughout this part, the most regulable space that man has ever<br/>known.<br/>
In this chapter, I describe the changes that could—and are—pushing the<br/>
Net from the unregulable space it was, to the perfectly regulable space it could<br/>be. These changes are not being architected by government. They are instead<br/>being demanded by users and deployed by commerce. They are not the prod-<br/>uct of some <i>1984</i>-inspired conspiracy; they are the consequence of changes<br/>made for purely pragmatic, commercial ends.<br/>
This obviously doesn’t make these changes bad or good. My purpose just<br/>
now is not normative, but descriptive. We should understand where we are<br/>going, and why, before we ask whether this is where, or who, we want to be.<br/>

The history of the future of the Internet was written in Germany in January<br/>1995. German law regulated porn. In Bavaria, it regulated porn heavily. Com-<br/>puServe made (a moderate amount of, through USENET,) porn available to its<br/>users. CompuServe was serving Bavaria’s citizens. Bavaria told CompuServe to<br/>remove the porn from its servers, or its executives would be punished.<br/>
CompuServe at first objected that there was nothing it could do—save<br/>
removing the porn from every server, everywhere in the world. That didn’t<br/>trouble the Germans much, but it did trouble CompuServe. So in January<br/>1995, CompuServe announced a technical fix: Rather than blocking access to<br/>the USENET newsgroups that the Bavarians had complained about for all<br/>members of CompuServe, CompuServe had devised a technology to filter<br/>content on a country-by-country basis.1<br/>
To make that fix work, CompuServe had to begin to reckon who a user<br/>
was, what they were doing, and where they were doing it. Technology could<br/>give them access to the data that needed reckoning. And with that shift, the<br/>future was set. An obvious response to a problem of regulability would begin<br/>to repeat itself.<br/>
CompuServe, of course, was not the Internet. But its response suggests the<br/>
pattern that the Internet will follow. In this Chapter, I map just how the Inter-<br/>net can effectively be made to run (in this respect at least) like CompuServe.<br/>
WHO DID WHAT, WHERE?<br/>
To regulate, the state needs a way to know the who, in “Who did what, where?”<br/>To see how the Net will show the state “who,” we need to think a bit more<br/>carefully about how “identification” works in general, and how it might work<br/>on the Internet.<br/>
Identity and Authentication: Real Space<br/>
To make sense of the technologies we use to identify who someone is, consider<br/>the relationship among three familiar ideas—(1) “identity,” (2) “authentica-<br/>tion,” and (3) “credential.”<br/>
By “identity” I mean something more than just who you are. I mean as<br/>
well your “attributes,” or more broadly, all the facts about you (or a corpora-<br/>tion, or a thing) that are true. Your identity, in this sense, includes your name,<br/>your sex, where you live, what your education is, your driver’s license number,<br/>your social security number, your purchases on Amazon.com, whether you’re<br/>a lawyer—and so on.<br/>

40<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
These attributes are known by others when they are communicated. In<br/>
real space, some are communicated automatically: for most, sex, skin color,<br/>height, age range, and whether you have a good smile get transmitted auto-<br/>matically. Other attributes can’t be known unless they are revealed either by<br/>you, or by someone else: your GPA in high school, your favorite color, your<br/>social security number, your last purchase on Amazon, whether you’ve passed<br/>a bar exam.<br/>
Just because an attribute has been asserted, however, does not mean the<br/>
attribute is believed. (“You passed the bar?!”) Rather belief will often depend<br/>upon a process of “authentication.” In general, we “authenticate” when we<br/>want to become more confident about the truth about some asserted claim<br/>than appears on its face. “I’m married,” you say. “Show me the ring,” she says.<br/>The first statement is an assertion about an attribute you claim you have. The<br/>second is a demand for authentication. We could imagine (in a comedy at<br/>least) that demand continuing. “Oh come on, that’s not a wedding ring. Show<br/>me your marriage license.” At some point, the demands stop, either when<br/>enough confidence has been achieved, or when the inquiry has just become<br/>too weird.<br/>
Sometimes this process of authentication is relatively automatic. Some<br/>
attributes, that is, are relatively self-authenticating: You say you’re a woman;<br/>I’m likely to believe it when I see you. You say you’re a native speaker; I’m<br/>likely to believe it once I speak with you. Of course, in both cases, I could be<br/>fooled. Thus, if my life depended upon it, I might take other steps to be<br/>absolutely confident of what otherwise appears plain. But for most purposes,<br/>with most familiar sorts of attributes, we learn how to evaluate without much<br/>more than our own individual judgment.<br/>
Some attributes, however, cannot be self-authenticating. You say you’re<br/>
licensed to fly an airplane; I want to see the license. You say you’re a member<br/>of the California bar; I want to see your certificate. You say you’re qualified to<br/>perform open heart surgery on my father; I want to see things that make me<br/>confident that your claim is true. Once again, these authenticating “things”<br/>could be forged, and my confidence could be unjustified. But if I’m careful to<br/>match the process for authentication with the level of confidence that I need,<br/>I’m behaving quite rationally. And most of us can usually get by without a ter-<br/>ribly complicated process of authentication.<br/>
One important tool sometimes used in this process of authentication is a<br/>
credential. By “credential,” I mean a standardized device for authenticating (to<br/>some level of confidence) an assertion made. A driver’s license is a credential<br/>in this sense. Its purpose is to authenticate the status of a driver. We’re gener-<br/>ally familiar with the form of such licenses; that gives us some confidence<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
41<br/>
that we’ll be able to determine whether a particular license is valid. A passport<br/>is also a credential in this sense. Its purpose is to establish the citizenship of<br/>the person it identifies, and it identifies a person through relatively self-<br/>authenticating attributes. Once again, we are familiar with the form of this<br/>credential, and that gives us a relatively high level of confidence about the facts<br/>asserted in that passport.<br/>
Obviously, some credentials are better than others. Some are architected<br/>
to give more confidence than others; some are more efficient at delivering<br/>their confidence than others. But we select among the credentials available<br/>depending upon the level of confidence that we need.<br/>
So take an obvious example to bring these points together: Imagine you’re<br/>
a bank teller. Someone appears in front of you and declares that she is the<br/>owner of account # 654–543231. She says she would like to withdraw all the<br/>money from that account.<br/>
In the sense I’ve described, this someone (call her Ms. X) has asserted a<br/>
fact about her identity—that she is the owner of account # 654–543231. Your<br/>job now is to authenticate that assertion. So you pull up on your computer the<br/>records for the account, and you discover that there’s lots of money in it. Now<br/>your desire to be confident about the authentication you make is even<br/>stronger. You ask Ms. X her name; that name matches the name on the<br/>account. That gives you some confidence. You ask Ms. X for two forms of<br/>identification. Both match to Ms. X. Now you have even more confidence. You<br/>ask Ms. X to sign a withdrawal slip. The signatures seem to match; more con-<br/>fidence still. Finally, you note in the record that the account was established by<br/>your manager. You ask her whether she knows Ms. X. She confirms that she<br/>does, and that the “Ms. X” standing at the counter is indeed Ms. X. Now you’re<br/>sufficiently confident to turn over the money.<br/>
Notice that throughout this process, you’ve used technologies to help you<br/>
authenticate the attribute asserted by Ms. X to be true. Your computer links a<br/>name to an account number. A driver’s license or passport ties a picture to a<br/>name. The computer keeps a copy of a signature. These are all technologies to<br/>increase confidence.<br/>
And notice too that we could imagine even better technologies to increase<br/>
this confidence. Credit cards, for example, were developed at a time when<br/>merely possessing the credit card authenticated its use. That design creates the<br/>incentive to steal a credit card. ATM cards are different—in addition to pos-<br/>session, ATM cards require a password. That design reduces the value of<br/>stolen cards. But some write their passwords on their ATM cards, or keep<br/>them in their wallets with their ATMs. This means the risk from theft is not<br/>totally removed. But that risk could be further reduced by other technologies<br/>

42<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
of authentication. For example, certain biometric technologies, such as<br/>thumbprint readers or eye scans, would increase the confidence that the<br/>holder of a card was an authorized user. (Though these technologies them-<br/>selves can create their own risks: At a conference I heard a vendor describing<br/>a new technology for identifying someone based upon his handprint; a par-<br/>ticipant in the conference asked whether the hand had to be alive for the<br/>authentication to work. The vendor went very pale. After a moment, he<br/>replied, “I guess not.”)<br/>
We are constantly negotiating these processes of authentication in real<br/>
life, and in this process, better technologies and better credentials enable more<br/>distant authentication. In a small town, in a quieter time, credentials were<br/>not necessary. You were known by your face, and your face carried with it a<br/>reference (held in the common knowledge of the community) about your<br/>character. But as life becomes more fluid, social institutions depend upon<br/>other technologies to build confidence around important identity assertions.<br/>Credentials thus become an unavoidable tool for securing such authentica-<br/>tion.<br/>
If technologies of authentication can be better or worse, then, obviously,<br/>
many have an interest in these technologies becoming better. We each would<br/>be better off if we could more easily and confidently authenticate certain facts<br/>about us. Commerce, too, would certainly be better off with better technolo-<br/>gies of authentication. Poor technologies begat fraud; fraud is an unproduc-<br/>tive cost for business. If better technology could eliminate that cost, then<br/>prices could be lower and profits possibly higher.<br/>
And finally, governments benefit from better technologies of authentica-<br/>
tion. If it is simple to authenticate your age, then rules that are triggered based<br/>upon age are more easily enforced (drinking ages, or limits on cigarettes).<br/>And if it is simple to authenticate who you are, then it will be easier for the<br/>government to trace who did what.<br/>
Fundamentally, the regulability of life in real-space depends upon certain<br/>
architectures of authentication. The fact that witnesses can identify who com-<br/>mitted a crime, either because they know the person or because of self-<br/>authenticating features such as “he was a white male, six feet tall,” enhances<br/>the ability of the state to regulate against that crime. If criminals were invisible<br/>or witnesses had no memory, crime would increase. The fact that fingerprints<br/>are hard to change and are now automatically traced to convicted felons<br/>increases the likelihood that felons will be caught again. Relying on a more<br/>changeable physical characteristic would reduce the ability of the police to<br/>track repeat offenders. The fact that cars have license plates and are registered<br/>by their owners increases the likelihood that a hit-and-run driver will be<br/>

caught. Without licenses, and without systems registering owners, it would be<br/>extremely difficult to track car-related crime. In all these cases, and in many<br/>more, technologies of authentication of real-space life make regulating that<br/>life possible.<br/>
These three separate interests therefore point to a common interest. That’s<br/>
not to say that every technology of authentication meets that common inter-<br/>est, nor is it to say that these interests will be enough to facilitate more effi-<br/>cient authentication. But it does mean that we can see which way these<br/>interests push. Better authentication can benefit everyone.<br/>
Identity and Authentication: Cyberspace<br/>
Identity and authentication in cyberspace and real space are in theory the<br/>same. In practice they are quite different. To see that difference, however, we<br/>need to see more about the technical detail of how the Net is built.<br/>
As I’ve already said, the Internet is built from a suite of protocols referred<br/>
to collectively as “TCP/IP.” At its core, the TCP/IP suite includes protocols for<br/>exchanging packets of data between two machines “on” the Net.2 Brutally sim-<br/>plified, the system takes a bunch of data (a file, for example), chops it up into<br/>packets, and slaps on the address to which the packet is to be sent and the<br/>address from which it is sent. The addresses are called Internet Protocol<br/>addresses, and they look like this: 128.34.35.204. Once properly addressed, the<br/>packets are then sent across the Internet to their intended destination.<br/>Machines along the way (“routers”) look at the address to which the packet is<br/>sent, and depending upon an (increasingly complicated) algorithm, the<br/>machines decide to which machine the packet should be sent next. A packet<br/>could make many “hops” between its start and its end. But as the network<br/>becomes faster and more robust, those many hops seem almost instantaneous.<br/>

44<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
In the terms I’ve described, there are many attributes that might be asso-<br/>
ciated with any packet of data sent across the network. For example, the<br/>packet might come from an e-mail written by Al Gore. That means the e-mail<br/>is written by a former vice president of the United States, by a man knowl-<br/>edgeable about global warming, by a man over the age of 50, by a tall man, by<br/>an American citizen, by a former member of the United States Senate, and so<br/>on. Imagine also that the e-mail was written while Al Gore was in Germany,<br/>and that it is about negotiations for climate control. The identity of that<br/>packet of information might be said to include all these attributes.<br/>
But the e-mail itself authenticates none of these facts. The e-mail may say<br/>
it’s from Al Gore, but the TCP/IP protocol alone gives us no way to be sure. It<br/>may have been written while Gore was in Germany, but he could have sent it<br/>through a server in Washington. And of course, while the system eventually<br/>will figure out that the packet is part of an e-mail, the information traveling<br/>across TCP/IP itself does not contain anything that would indicate what the<br/>content was. The protocol thus doesn’t authenticate who sent the packet,<br/>where they sent it from, and what the packet is. All it purports to assert is an<br/>IP address to which the packet is to be sent, and an IP address from which the<br/>packet comes. From the perspective of the network, this other information is<br/>unnecessary surplus. Like a daydreaming postal worker, the network simply<br/>moves the data and leaves its interpretation to the applications at either end.<br/>
This minimalism in the Internet’s design was not an accident. It reflects a<br/>
decision about how best to design a network to perform a wide range over<br/>very different functions. Rather than build into this network a complex set of<br/>functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network<br/>philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network—to the applications<br/>that run on the network, rather than the network’s core. The core is kept as<br/>simple as possible. Thus if authentication about who is using the network is<br/>necessary, that functionality should be performed by an application con-<br/>nected to the network, not by the network itself. Or if content needs to be<br/>encrypted, that functionality should be performed by an application con-<br/>nected to the network, not by the network itself.<br/>
This design principle was named by network architects Jerome Saltzer,<br/>
David Clark, and David Reed as the end-to-end principle.3 It has been a core<br/>principle of the Internet’s architecture, and, in my view, one of the most<br/>important reasons that the Internet produced the innovation and growth that<br/>it has enjoyed. But its consequences for purposes of identification and authen-<br/>tication make both extremely difficult with the basic protocols of the Internet<br/>alone. It is as if you were in a carnival funhouse with the lights dimmed to<br/>darkness and voices coming from around you, but from people you do not<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
45<br/>
know and from places you cannot identify. The system knows that there are<br/>entities out there interacting with it, but it knows nothing about who those<br/>entities are. While in real space—and here is the important point—anonymity<br/>has to be created, in cyberspace anonymity is the given.<br/>
Identity and Authentication: Regulability<br/>
This difference in the architectures of real space and cyberspace makes a big<br/>difference in the regulability of behavior in each. The absence of relatively self-<br/>authenticating facts in cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to regulate<br/>behavior there. If we could all walk around as “The Invisible Man” in real<br/>space, the same would be true about real space as well. That we’re not capable<br/>of becoming invisible in real space (or at least not easily) is an important rea-<br/>son that regulation can work.<br/>
Thus, for example, if a state wants to control children’s access to “inde-<br/>
cent” speech on the Internet, the original Internet architecture provides little<br/>help. The state can say to websites, “don’t let kids see porn.” But the website<br/>operators can’t know—from the data provided by the TCP/IP protocols at<br/>least—whether the entity accessing its web page is a kid or an adult. That’s dif-<br/>ferent, again, from real space. If a kid walks into a porn shop wearing a mus-<br/>tache and stilts, his effort to conceal is likely to fail. The attribute “being a kid”<br/>is asserted in real space, even if efforts to conceal it are possible. But in cyber-<br/>space, there’s no need to conceal, because the facts you might want to conceal<br/>about your identity (i.e., that you’re a kid) are not asserted anyway.<br/>
All this is true, at least, under the basic Internet architecture. But as the<br/>
last ten years have made clear, none of this is true by necessity. To the extent<br/>that the lack of efficient technologies for authenticating facts about individ-<br/>uals makes it harder to regulate behavior, there are architectures that could be<br/>layered onto the TCP/IP protocol to create efficient authentication. We’re far<br/>enough into the history of the Internet to see what these technologies could<br/>look like. We’re far enough into this history to see that the trend toward this<br/>authentication is unstoppable. The only question is whether we will build<br/>into this system of authentication the kinds of protections for privacy and<br/>autonomy that are needed.<br/>
Architectures of Identification<br/>
Most who use the Internet have no real sense about whether their behavior is<br/>monitored, or traceable. Instead, the experience of the Net suggests<br/>anonymity. Wikipedia doesn’t say “Welcome Back, Larry” when I surf to its<br/>

46<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
site to look up an entry, and neither does Google. Most, I expect, take this lack<br/>of acknowledgement to mean that no one is noticing.<br/>
But appearances are quite deceiving. In fact, as the Internet has matured,<br/>
the technologies for linking behavior with an identity have increased dra-<br/>matically. You can still take steps to assure anonymity on the Net, and many<br/>depend upon that ability to do good (human rights workers in Burma) or evil<br/>(coordinating terrorist plots). But to achieve that anonymity takes effort. For<br/>most of us, our use of the Internet has been made at least traceable in ways<br/>most of us would never even consider possible.<br/>
Consider first the traceability resulting from the basic protocols of the<br/>
Internet—TCP/IP. Whenever you make a request to view a page on the Web,<br/>the web server needs to know where to sent the packets of data that will<br/>appear as a web page in your browser. Your computer thus tells the web server<br/>where you are—in IP space at least—by revealing an IP address.<br/>
As I’ve already described, the IP address itself doesn’t reveal anything<br/>
about who you are, or where in physical space you come from. But it does<br/>enable a certain kind of trace. If (1) you have gotten access to the web through<br/>an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that assigns you an IP address while you’re<br/>on the Internet and (2) that ISP keeps the logs of that assignment, then it’s<br/>perfectly possible to trace your surfing back to you.<br/>
How?<br/>Well, imagine you’re angry at your boss. You think she’s a blowhard who<br/>
is driving the company into bankruptcy. After months of frustration, you<br/>decide to go public. Not “public” as in a press conference, but public as in a<br/>posting to an online forum within which your company is being discussed.<br/>
You know you’d get in lots of trouble if your criticism were tied back to<br/>
you. So you take steps to be “anonymous” on the forum. Maybe you create an<br/>account in the forum under a fictitious name, and that fictitious name makes<br/>you feel safe. Your boss may see the nasty post, but even if she succeeds in get-<br/>ting the forum host to reveal what you said when you signed up, all that stuff<br/>was bogus. Your secret, you believe, is safe.<br/>
Wrong. In addition to the identification that your username might, or<br/>
might not, provide, if the forum is on the web, then it knows the IP address<br/>from which you made your post. With that IP address, and the time you made<br/>your post, using “a reverse DNS look-up,”4 it is simple to identify the Internet<br/>Service Provider that gave you access to the Internet. And increasingly, it is rel-<br/>atively simple for the Internet Service Provider to check its records to reveal<br/>which account was using that IP address at that specified time. Thus, the ISP<br/>could (if required) say that it was your account that was using the IP address<br/>that posted the nasty message about your boss. Try as you will to deny it<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
47<br/>
(“Hey, on the Internet, no one knows you’re a dog!”), I’d advise you to give up<br/>quickly. They’ve got you. You’ve been trapped by the Net. Dog or no, you’re<br/>definitely in the doghouse.<br/>
Now again, what made this tracing possible? No plan by the NSA. No<br/>
strategy of Microsoft. Instead, what made this tracing possible was a by-prod-<br/>uct of the architecture of the Web and the architecture of ISPs charging access<br/>to the Web. The Web must know an IP address; ISPs require identification<br/>before they assign an IP address to a customer. So long as the log records of<br/>the ISP are kept, the transaction is traceable. Bottom line: If you want<br/>anonymity, use a pay phone!<br/>
This traceability in the Internet raised some important concerns at the<br/>
beginning of 2006. Google announced it would fight a demand by the govern-<br/>ment to produce one million sample searches. (MSN and Yahoo! had both<br/>complied with the same request.) That request was made as part of an inves-<br/>tigation the government was conducting to support its defense of a statute<br/>designed to block kids from porn. And though the request promised the data<br/>would be used for no other purpose, it raised deep concerns in the Internet<br/>community. Depending upon the data that Google kept, the request showed<br/>in principle that it was possible to trace legally troubling searches back to<br/>individual IP addresses (and to individuals with Google accounts). Thus, for<br/>example, if your Internet address at work is a fixed-IP address, then every<br/>search you’ve ever made from work is at least possibly kept by Google. Does<br/>that make you concerned? And assume for the moment you are not a<br/>terrorist: Would you still be concerned?<br/>
A link back to an IP address, however, only facilitates tracing, and again,<br/>
even then not perfect traceability. ISPs don’t keep data for long (ordinarily);<br/>some don’t even keep assignment records at all. And if you’ve accessed the<br/>Internet at an Internet café, then there’s no reason to believe anything could<br/>be traced back to you. So still, the Internet provides at least some anonymity.<br/>
But IP tracing isn’t the only technology of identification that has been lay-<br/>
ered onto the Internet. A much more pervasive technology was developed<br/>early in the history of the Web to make the web more valuable to commerce<br/>and its customers. This is the technology referred to as “cookies.”<br/>
When the World Wide Web was first deployed, the protocol simply<br/>
enabled people to view content that had been marked up in a special pro-<br/>gramming language. This language (HTML) made it easy to link to other<br/>pages, and it made it simple to apply basic formatting to the content (bold, or<br/>italics, for example).<br/>
But the one thing the protocol didn’t enable was a simple way for a web-<br/>
site to know which machines had accessed it. The protocol was “state-less.”<br/>

48<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
When a web server received a request to serve a web page, it didn’t know any-<br/>thing about the state of the requester before that request was made.5<br/>
From the perspective of privacy, this sounds like a great feature for the<br/>
Web. Why should a website know anything about me if I go to that site to view<br/>certain content? You don’t have to be a criminal to appreciate the value in<br/>anonymous browsing. Imagine libraries kept records of every time you<br/>opened a book at the library, even for just a second.<br/>
Yet from the perspective of commerce, this “feature” of the original Web<br/>
is plainly a bug, and not because commercial sites necessarily want to know<br/>everything there is to know about you. Instead, the problem is much more<br/>pragmatic. Say you go to Amazon.com and indicate you want to buy 20 copies<br/>of my latest book. (Try it. It’s fun.) Now your “shopping cart” has 20 copies of<br/>my book. You then click on the icon to check out, and you notice your shop-<br/>ping cart is empty. Why? Well because, as originally architected, the Web had<br/>no easy way to recognize that you were the same entity that just ordered 20<br/>books. Or put differently, the web server would simply forget you. The Web as<br/>originally built had no way to remember you from one page to another. And<br/>thus, the Web as originally built would not be of much use to commerce.<br/>
But as I’ve said again and again, the way the Web was is not the way the<br/>
Web had to be. And so those who were building the infrastructure of the Web<br/>quickly began to think through how the web could be “improved” to make it<br/>easy for commerce to happen. “Cookies” were the solution. In 1994, Netscape<br/>introduced a protocol to make it possible for a web server to deposit a small<br/>bit of data on your computer when you accessed that server. That small bit of<br/>data—the “cookie”—made it possible for the server to recognize you when<br/>you traveled to a different page. Of course, there are lots of other concerns<br/>about what that cookie might enable. We’ll get to those in the chapter about<br/>privacy. The point that’s important here, however, is not the dangers this tech-<br/>nology creates. The point is the potential and how that potential was built. A<br/>small change in the protocol for client-server interaction now makes it possi-<br/>ble for websites to monitor and track those who use the site.<br/>
This is a small step toward authenticated identity. It’s far from that, but it<br/>
is a step toward it. Your computer isn’t you (yet). But cookies make it possible<br/>for the computer to authenticate that it is the same machine that was access-<br/>ing a website a moment before. And it is upon this technology that the whole<br/>of web commerce initially was built. Servers could now “know” that this<br/>machine is the same machine that was here before. And from that knowledge,<br/>they could build a great deal of value.<br/>
Now again, strictly speaking, cookies are nothing more than a tracing<br/>
technology. They make it simple to trace a machine across web pages. That<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
49<br/>
tracing doesn’t necessarily reveal any information about the user. Just as we<br/>could follow a trail of cookie crumbs in real space to an empty room, a web<br/>server could follow a trail of “mouse droppings” from the first entry on the<br/>site until the user leaves. In both cases, nothing is necessarily revealed about<br/>the user.<br/>
But sometimes something important is revealed about the user by associ-<br/>
ation with data stored elsewhere. For example, imagine you enter a site, and it<br/>asks you to reveal your name, your telephone number, and your e-mail address<br/>as a condition of entering a contest. You trust the website, and do that, and<br/>then you leave the website. The next day, you come back, and you browse<br/>through a number of pages on that website. In this interaction, of course,<br/>you’ve revealed nothing. But if a cookie was deposited on your machine<br/>through your browser (and you have not taken steps to remove it), then when<br/>you return to the site, the website again “knows” all these facts about you. The<br/>cookie traces your machine, and this trace links back to a place where you<br/>provided information the machine would not otherwise know.<br/>
The traceability of IP addresses and cookies is the default on the Internet<br/>
now. Again, steps can be taken to avoid this traceability, but the vast majority<br/>of us don’t take them. Fortunately, for society and for most of us, what we do<br/>on the Net doesn’t really concern anyone. But if it did concern someone, it<br/>wouldn’t be hard to track us down. We are a people who leave our “mouse<br/>droppings” everywhere.<br/>
This default traceability, however, is not enough for some. They require<br/>
something more. That was Harvard’s view, as I noted in the previous chapter.<br/>That is also the view of just about all private networks today. A variety of<br/>technologies have developed that enable stronger authentication by those<br/>who use the Net. I will describe two of these technologies in this section. But<br/>it is the second of these two that will, in my view, prove to be the most impor-<br/>tant.<br/>
The first of these technologies is the Single Sign-on (SSO) technology.<br/>
This technology allows someone to “sign-on” to a network once, and then get<br/>access to a wide range of resources on that network without needing to<br/>authenticate again. Think of it as a badge you wear at your place of work.<br/>Depending upon what the badge says (“visitor” or “researcher”) you get dif-<br/>ferent access to different parts of the building. And like a badge at a place of<br/>work, you get the credential by giving up other data. You give the receptionist<br/>an ID; he gives you a badge; you wear that badge wherever you go while at the<br/>business.<br/>
The most commonly deployed SSO is a system called Kerberos. But<br/>
there are many different SSOs out there—Microsoft’s Passport system is an<br/>

50<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
example—and there is a strong push to build federated SSOs for linking many<br/>different sites on the Internet. Thus, for example, in a federated system, I<br/>might authenticate myself to my university, but then I could move across any<br/>domain within the federation without authenticating again. The big advan-<br/>tage in this architecture is that I can authenticate to the institution I trust<br/>without spreading lots of data about myself to institutions I don’t trust.<br/>
SSOs have been very important in building identity into the Internet. But<br/>
a second technology, I believe, will become the most important tool for iden-<br/>tification in the next ten years. This is because this alternative respects impor-<br/>tant architectural features of the Internet, and because the demand for better<br/>technologies of identification will continue to be strong. Forget the hassle of<br/>typing your name and address at every site you want to buy something from.<br/>You only need to think about the extraordinary growth in identity theft to rec-<br/>ognize there are many who would be eager to see something better come<br/>along.<br/>
To understand this second system, think first about how credentials work<br/>
in real space.6 You’ve got a wallet. In it is likely to be a driver’s license, some<br/>credit cards, a health insurance card, an ID for where you work, and, if you’re<br/>lucky, some money. Each of these cards can be used to authenticate some fact<br/>about you—again, with very different levels of confidence. The driver’s license<br/>has a picture and a list of physical characteristics. That’s enough for a wine<br/>store, but not enough for the NSA. The credit card has your signature. Ven-<br/>dors are supposed to use that data to authenticate that the person who signs<br/>the bill is the owner of the card. If the vendor becomes suspicious, she might<br/>demand that you show an ID as well.<br/>
Notice the critical features of this “wallet” architecture. First, these creden-<br/>
tials are issued by different entities. Second, depending upon their technology,<br/>they offer different levels of confidence. Third, I’m free to use these credentials<br/>in ways never originally planned or intended by the issuer of the credential.<br/>The Department of Motor Vehicles never coordinated with Visa to enable<br/>driver’s licenses to be used to authenticate the holder of a credit card. But<br/>once the one was prevalent, the other could use it. And fourth, nothing<br/>requires that I show all my cards when I can use just one. That is, to show my<br/>driver’s license, I don’t also reveal my health insurance card. Or to use my Visa,<br/>I don’t also have to reveal my American Express card.<br/>
These same features are at the core of what may prove to be the most<br/>
important addition to the effective architecture of the Internet since its birth.<br/>This is a project being led by Microsoft to essentially develop an Identity<br/>Metasystem—a new layer of the Internet, an Identity Layer, that would com-<br/>plement the existing network layers to add a new kind of functionality. This<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
51<br/>
Identity Layer is not Microsoft Passport, or some other Single Sign-On tech-<br/>nology. Instead it is a protocol to enable a kind of virtual wallet of credentials,<br/>with all the same attributes of the credentials in your wallet—except better.<br/>This virtual wallet will not only be more reliable than the wallet in your<br/>pocket, it will also give you the ability to control more precisely what data<br/>about you is revealed to those who demand data about you.<br/>
For example, in real space, your wallet can easily be stolen. If it’s stolen,<br/>
then there’s a period of time when it’s relatively easy for the thief to use the<br/>cards to buy stuff. In cyberspace, these wallets are not easily stolen. Indeed, if<br/>they’re architected well, it would be practically impossible to “steal” them.<br/>Remove the cards from their holder, and they become useless digital objects.<br/>
Or again, in real space, if you want to authenticate that you’re over 21 and<br/>
therefore can buy a six-pack of beer, you show the clerk your driver’s license.<br/>With that, he authenticates your age. But with that bit of data, he also gets<br/>access to your name, your address, and in some states, your social security<br/>number. Those other bits of data are not necessary for him to know. In some<br/>contexts, depending on how creepy he is, these data are exactly the sort you<br/>don’t want him to know. But the inefficiencies of real-space technologies<br/>reveal these data. This loss of privacy is a cost of doing business.<br/>
The virtual wallet would be different. If you need to authenticate your age,<br/>
the technology could authenticate that fact alone—indeed, it could authenti-<br/>cate simply that you’re over 21, or over 65, or under 18, without revealing any-<br/>thing more. Or if you need to authenticate your citizenship, that fact can be<br/>certified without revealing your name, or where you live, or your passport<br/>number. The technology is crafted to reveal just what you want it to reveal,<br/>without also revealing other stuff. (As one of the key architects for this meta-<br/>system, Kim Cameron, described it: “To me, that’s the center of the system.”7)<br/>And, most importantly, using the power of cryptography, the protocol makes<br/>it possible for the other side to be confident about the fact you reveal without<br/>requiring any more data.<br/>
The brilliance in this solution to the problems of identification is first<br/>
that it mirrors the basic architecture of the Internet. There’s no central repos-<br/>itory for data; there’s no network technology that everyone must adopt. There<br/>is instead a platform for building identity technologies that encourages com-<br/>petition among different privacy and security providers—TCP/IP for identity.<br/>Microsoft may be leading the project, but anyone can build for this protocol.<br/>Nothing ties the protocol to the Windows operating system. Or to any other<br/>specific vendor. As Cameron wisely puts it, “it can’t be owned by any one<br/>company or any one country . . . or just have the technology stamp of any one<br/>engineer.”8<br/>

52<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
The Identity Layer is infrastructure for the Internet. It gives value (and<br/>
raises concerns) to many beyond Microsoft. But though Microsoft’s work is<br/>an important gift to the Internet, the Identity Layer is not altruism.<br/>“Microsoft’s strategy is based on web services,” Cameron described to me.<br/>“Web services are impossible without identity.”9 There is important public<br/>value here, but private interest is driving the deployment of this public value.<br/>
The Identity Layer would benefit individuals, businesses, and the gov-<br/>
ernment, but each differently. Individuals could more easily protect them-<br/>selves from identity theft;10 if you get an e-mail from PayPal demanding you<br/>update your account, you’ll know whether the website is actually PayPal. Or if<br/>you want to protect yourself against spam, you could block all e-mail that<br/>doesn’t come from an authenticated server. In either case, the technology is<br/>increasing confidence about the Internet. And the harms that come from a<br/>lack of confidence—mainly fraud—would therefore be reduced.<br/>
Commerce too would benefit from this form of technology. It too benefits<br/>
from the reduction of fraud. And it too would benefit from a more secure<br/>infrastructure for conducting online transactions.<br/>
And finally, the government would benefit from this infrastructure of<br/>
trust. If there were a simple way to demand that people authenticate facts<br/>about themselves, it would be easier for the government to insist that they do<br/>so. If it were easier to have high confidence that the person on the website was<br/>who he said he was, then it would be cheaper to deliver certain information<br/>across the web.<br/>
But while individuals, commerce, and government would all benefit from<br/>
this sort of technology, there is also something that each could lose.<br/>
Individuals right now can be effectively anonymous on the Net. A plat-<br/>
form for authenticated identity would make anonymity much harder. We<br/>might imagine, for example, a norm developing to block access to a website by<br/>anyone not carrying a token that at least made it possible to trace back to the<br/>user—a kind of driver’s license for the Internet. That norm, plus this technol-<br/>ogy, would make anonymous speech extremely difficult.<br/>
Commerce could also lose something from this design. To the extent that<br/>
there are simple ways to authenticate that I am the authorized user of this<br/>credit card, for example, it’s less necessary for websites to demand all sorts of<br/>data about me—my address, my telephone numbers, and in one case I<br/>recently encountered, my birthday. That fact could build a norm against<br/>revealing extraneous data. But that data may be valuable to business beyond<br/>simply confirming a charge.<br/>
And governments, too, may lose something from this architecture of<br/>
identification. Just as commerce may lose the extra data that individuals need<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
53<br/>
to reveal to authenticate themselves, so too will the government lose that. It<br/>may feel that such data is necessary for some other purpose, but gathering it<br/>would become more difficult.<br/>
Each of these benefits and costs can be adjusted, depending upon how the<br/>
technology is implemented. And as the resulting mix of privacy and security<br/>is the product of competition and an equilibrium between individuals and<br/>businesses, there’s no way up front to predict what it will be.<br/>
But for our purposes, the only important fact to notice is that this infra-<br/>
structure could effectively answer the first question that regulability requires<br/>answering: <i>Who </i>did what where? With an infrastructure enabling cheap iden-<br/>tification wherever you are, the frequency of unidentified activity falls dra-<br/>matically.<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
This final example of an identification technology throws into relief an<br/>important fact about encryption technology. The Identity Layer depends<br/>upon cryptography. It thus demonstrates the sense in which cryptography is<br/>Janus-faced. As Stewart Baker and Paul Hurst put it, cryptography “surely is<br/>the best of technologies and the worst of technologies. It will stop crimes and<br/>it will create new crimes. It will undermine dictatorships, and it will drive<br/>them to new excesses. It will make us all anonymous, and it will track our<br/>every transaction.”11<br/>
Cryptography can be all these things, both good and bad, because encryp-<br/>
tion can serve two fundamentally different ends. In its “confidentiality” func-<br/>tion it can be “used to keep communications secret.” In its “identification”<br/>function it can be “used to provide forgery-proof digital identities.”12 It<br/>enables freedom from regulation (as it enhances confidentiality), but it can<br/>also enable more efficient regulation (as it enhances identification).13<br/>
Its traditional use is secrets. Encrypt a message, and only those with the<br/>
proper key can open and read it. This type of encryption has been around as<br/>long as language itself. But until the mid-1970s it suffered from an important<br/>weakness: the same key that was used to encrypt a message was also used to<br/>decrypt it. So if you lost that key, all the messages hidden with that key were<br/>also rendered vulnerable. If a large number of messages were encrypted with<br/>the same key, losing the key compromised the whole archive of secrets pro-<br/>tected by the key. This risk was significant. You always had to “transport” the<br/>key needed to unlock the message, and inherent in that transport was the<br/>risk that the key would be lost.<br/>
In the mid-1970s, however, a breakthrough in encryption technique was<br/>
announced by two computer scientists, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hell-<br/>man.14 Rather than relying on a single key, the Diffie-Hellman system used<br/>

54<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
two keys—one public, the other private. What is encrypted with one can be<br/>decrypted only with the other. Even with one key there is no way to infer the<br/>other.<br/>
This discovery was the clue to an architecture that could build an extraor-<br/>
dinary range of confidence into any network, whether or not the physical<br/>network itself was secure.15 And again, that confidence could both make me<br/>confident that my secrets won’t be revealed and make me confident that the<br/>person using my site just now is you. The technology therefore works to keep<br/>secrets, but it also makes it harder to keep secrets. It works to make stuff less<br/>regulable, and more regulable.<br/>
In the Internet’s first life, encryption technology was on the side of pri-<br/>
vacy. Its most common use was to keep information secret. But in the Inter-<br/>net’s next life, encryption technology’s most important role will be in making<br/>the Net more regulable. As an Identity Layer gets built into the Net, the easy<br/>ability to demand some form of identity as a condition to accessing the<br/>resources of the Net increases. As that ability increases, its prevalence will<br/>increase as well. Indeed, as Shawn Helms describes, the next generation of the<br/>Internet Protocol—IPv6—“marks each packet with an encryption ‘key’ that<br/>cannot be altered or forged, thus securely identifying the packet’s origin. This<br/>authentication function can identify every sender and receiver of information<br/>over the Internet, thus making it nearly impossible for people to remain<br/>anonymous on the Internet.”16<br/>
And even if not impossible, sufficiently difficult for the vast majority of<br/>
us. Our packets will be marked. We—or something about us—will be known.<br/>
WHO DID WHAT, WHERE?<br/>
Regulability also depends upon knowing the “what” in “who did what,<br/>where?” But again, the Internet as originally designed didn’t help the regulator<br/>here either. If the Internet protocol simply cuts up data into packets and<br/>stamps an address on them, then nothing in the basic protocol would tell<br/>anyone looking at the packet what the packet was for.<br/>
For example, imagine you’re a telephone company providing broadband<br/>
Internet access (DSL) across your telephone lines. Some smart innovator<br/>develops Voice-over-IP (VOIP)—an application that makes it possible to use<br/>the Internet to make telephone calls. You, the phone company, aren’t happy<br/>about that, because now people using your DSL service can make unmetered<br/>telephone calls. That freedom cuts into your profit.<br/>
Is there anything you can do about this? Relying upon just the Internet<br/>
protocols, the answer is no. The “packets” of data that contain the simulated-<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
55<br/>
telephone calls look just like any packet of data. They don’t come labeled with<br/>VOIP or any other consistent moniker. Instead, packets are simply marked<br/>with addresses. They are not marked with explanations of what is going on<br/>with each.<br/>
But as my example is meant to suggest, we can easily understand why<br/>
some would be very keen to understand what packets are flowing across their<br/>network, and not just for anti-competitive purposes. Network administrators<br/>trying to decide whether to add new capacity need to know what the existing<br/>capacity is being used for. Businesses keen to avoid their employees wasting<br/>time with sports or porn have a strong interest in knowing just what their<br/>employees are doing. Universities trying to avoid viruses or malware being<br/>installed on network computers need to know what kind of packets are flow-<br/>ing onto their network. In all these cases, there’s an obvious and valid <i>will </i>to<br/>identify what packets are flowing on the network. And as they say, where<br/>there’s a will, there’s a way.<br/>
The way follows the same technique described in the section above. Again,<br/>
the TCP/IP protocol doesn’t include technology for identifying the content<br/>carried in TCP/IP packets. But it also doesn’t interfere with applications that<br/>might examine TCP/IP packets and report what those packets are about.<br/>
So, for example, consider a package produced by Ipanema Technologies.<br/>
This technology enables a network owner to inspect the packets traveling on<br/>its network. As its webpage promises,<br/>
The Ipanema Systems “deep” layer 7 packet inspection automatically recognizes<br/>
all critical business and recreational application flows running over the network.<br/>
Real-time graphical interfaces as well as minute-by-minute reports are available<br/>
to rapidly discover newly deployed applications.17<br/>
Using the data gathered by this technology, the system generates reports<br/>
about the applications being used in the network, and who’s using them.<br/>These technologies make it possible to control network use, either to econo-<br/>mize on bandwidth costs, or to block uses that the network owner doesn’t per-<br/>mit.<br/>
Another example of this kind of content control is a product called “iPro-<br/>
tectYou.”18 This product also scans packets on a network, but this control is<br/>implemented at the level of a particular machine. Parents load this software<br/>on a computer; the software then monitors all network traffic with that com-<br/>puter. As the company describes, the program can then “filter harmful web-<br/>sites and newsgroups; restrict Internet time to a predetermined schedule;<br/>decide which programs can have Internet access; limit the amount of data that<br/>

56<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
can be sent or received to/from your computer; block e-mails, online chats,<br/>instant messages and P2P connections containing inappropriate words; [and<br/>produce] detailed Internet activity logs.” Once again, this is an application that<br/>sits on top of the network and watches. It intervenes in network activity when<br/>it identifies the activity as the kind the administrator wants to control.<br/>
In addition to these technologies of control, programmers have developed<br/>
a wide range of programs to monitor networks. Perhaps the dominant appli-<br/>cation in this context is called “nmap”—a program<br/>
for network exploration or security auditing . . . designed to rapidly scan large net-<br/>
works. . . . Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are<br/>
available on the network, what services (application name and version) those<br/>
hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running,<br/>
what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.19<br/>
This software is “free software,” meaning the source code is available, and<br/>
any modifications of the source code must be made available as well. These<br/>conditions essentially guarantee that the code necessary to engage in this<br/>monitoring will always be available.<br/>
Finally, coders have developed “packet filtering” technology, which, as<br/>
one popular example describes, “is the selective passing or blocking of data<br/>packets as they pass through a network interface. . . . The most often used cri-<br/>teria are source and destination address, source and destination port, and<br/>protocol.” This again is a technology that’s monitoring “what” is carried<br/>within packets, and decides what’s allowed based upon what it finds.<br/>
In each of these cases, a layer of code complements the TCP/IP protocol,<br/>
to give network administrators something TCP/IP alone would not—namely,<br/>knowledge about “what” is carried in the network packets. That knowledge<br/>increases the “regulability” of network use. If a company doesn’t want its<br/>employees using IM chat, then these technologies will enforce that rule—by<br/>blocking the packets containing IM chat. Or if a company wants to know<br/>which employees use sexually explicit speech in Internet communication,<br/>these technologies will reveal that as well. Again, there are plenty of perfectly<br/>respectable reasons why network administrators might want to exercise this<br/>regulatory authority—even if there are plenty of cases where such power<br/>would be an abuse. Because of this legitimate demand, software products like<br/>this are developed.<br/>
Now, of course, there are countermeasures that users can adopt to avoid<br/>
just this sort of monitoring. A user who encrypts the data he sends across the<br/>network will avoid any filtering on the basis of key words. And there are plenty<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
57<br/>
of technologies designed to “anonymize” behavior on the Net, so administra-<br/>tors can’t easily know what an individual is doing on a network. But these<br/>countermeasures require a significant investment for a particular user to<br/>deploy—whether of time or money. The vast majority won’t bother, and the<br/>ability of network administrators to monitor content and use of the network<br/>will be preserved.<br/>
Thus, as with changes that increased the ability to identify “who” someone<br/>
is who is using a network, here too, private interests provide a sufficient incen-<br/>tive to develop technologies that make it increasingly easy to say “what” some-<br/>one is doing who is using a network. A gap in the knowledge provided by the<br/>plain vanilla Internet is thus plugged by these privately developed technologies.<br/>
WHO DID WHAT, WHERE?<br/>
Finally, as long as different jurisdictions impose different requirements, the<br/>third bit of data necessary to regulate efficiently is knowing where the target of<br/>regulation is. If France forbids the selling of Nazi paraphernalia, but the United<br/>States does not, then a website wanting to respect the laws of France must know<br/>something about where the person accessing the Internet is coming from.<br/>
But once again, the Internet protocols didn’t provide that data. And thus,<br/>
it would be extremely difficult to regulate or zone access to content on the<br/>basis of geography.<br/>
The original Internet made such regulation extremely difficult. As origi-<br/>
nally deployed, as one court put it:<br/>
The Internet is wholly insensitive to geographic distinctions. In almost every<br/>
case, users of the Internet neither know nor care about the physical location of<br/>
the Internet resources they access. Internet protocols were designed to ignore<br/>
rather than document geographic location; while computers on the network<br/>
do have “addresses,” they are logical addresses on the network rather than geo-<br/>
graphic addresses in real space. The majority of Internet addresses contain no<br/>
geographic clues and, even where an Internet address provides such a clue, it<br/>
may be misleading.20<br/>
But once again, commerce has come to the rescue of regulability. There<br/>
are obvious reasons why it would useful to be able to identify where someone<br/>is when they access some website. Some of those reasons have to do with reg-<br/>ulation—again, blocking Nazi material from the French, or porn from kids in<br/>Kansas. We’ll consider these reasons more extensively later in this book. For<br/>now, however, the most interesting reasons are those tied purely to commerce.<br/>

58<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
And, again, these commercial reasons are sufficient to induce the development<br/>of this technology.<br/>
Once again, the gap in the data necessary to identify someone’s location<br/>
is the product of the way IP addresses are assigned. IP addresses are virtual<br/>addresses; they don’t refer to a particular geographic place. They refer to a log-<br/>ical place on the network. Thus, two IP addresses in principle could be very<br/>close to each other in number, but very far from each other in geography.<br/>That’s not the way, for example, zip codes work. If your zip code is one digit<br/>from mine (e.g., 94115 vs. 94116), we’re practically neighbors.<br/>
But this gap in data is simply the gap in data about where someone is<br/>
deducible from his IP address. That means, while there’s no simple way to<br/>deduce from 23.214.23.15 that someone is in California, it is certainly possible<br/>to gather the data necessary to map where someone is, given the IP address. To<br/>do this, one needs to construct a table of IP addresses and geographic loca-<br/>tions, and then track both the ultimate IP address and the path along which<br/>a packet has traveled to where you are from where it was sent. Thus while the<br/>TCP/IP protocol can’t reveal where someone is directly, it can be used indi-<br/>rectly to reveal at least the origin or destination of an IP packet.<br/>
The commercial motivations for this knowledge are obvious. Jack Gold-<br/>
smith and Tim Wu tell the story of a particularly famous entrepreneur, Cyril<br/>Houri, who was inspired to develop IP mapping technology. Sitting in his<br/>hotel in Paris one night, he accessed his e-mail account in the United States.<br/>His e-mail was hosted on a web server, but he noticed that the banner ads at<br/>the top of the website were advertising an American flower company. That<br/>gave him a (now obvious) idea: Why not build a tool to make it easy for a<br/>website to know from where it is being accessed, so it can serve relevant ads to<br/>those users?21<br/>
Houri’s idea has been copied by many. Geoselect, for example, is a com-<br/>
pany that provides IP mapping services. Just browse to their webpage, and<br/>they’re 99 percent likely to be able to tell you automatically where you are<br/>browsing from. Using their services, you can get a geographical report listing<br/>the location of the people who visit your site, and you can use their products<br/>to automatically update log files on your web server with geographic data. You<br/>can automatically change the greeting on your website depending upon where<br/>the user comes from, and you can automatically redirect a user based upon<br/>her location. All of this functionality is invisible to the user. All he sees is a web<br/>page constructed by tools that know something that the TCP/IP alone doesn’t<br/>reveal—where someone is from.<br/>
So what commercial reasons do websites have for using such software?<br/>
One company, MaxMind,22 lists the major reason as credit card fraud: If your<br/>

architectures of control<br/>
59<br/>
customer comes from a “high risk IP address”—meaning a location where it’s<br/>likely the person is engaged in credit card fraud—then MaxMind’s service will<br/>flag the transaction and direct that it have greater security verification. Max-<br/>Mind also promises the service will be valuable for “targeted advertising.” Using<br/>its product, a client can target a message based upon country, state, or city, as<br/>well as a “metropolitan code,” an area code, and connection speed of the user<br/>(no need to advertise DVD downloads to a person on a dial-up connection).<br/>
Here too there is an important and powerful open source application<br/>
that provides the same IP mapping functions. Hostip.info gives website oper-<br/>ators—for free—the ability to “geolocate” the users of their site.23 This again<br/>means that the core functionality of IP mapping is not held exclusively by cor-<br/>porations or a few individuals. Any application developer—including a gov-<br/>ernment—could incorporate the function into its applications. The<br/>knowledge and functionality is free.<br/>
Thus, again, one of the original gaps in the data necessary to make behav-<br/>
ior regulable on the Internet—geographic identity—has been filled. But it<br/>has not been filled by government mandate or secret NSA operations (or so<br/>I hope). Instead, the gap has been filled by a commercial interest in providing<br/>the data the network itself didn’t. Technology now layers onto the Internet to<br/>produce the data the network needs.<br/>
But it is still possible to evade identification. Civil liberty activist Seth<br/>
Finkelstein has testified to the relative ease with which one can evade this<br/>tracking.24 Yet as I will describe more below, even easily evaded tracking can<br/>be effective tracking. And when tied to the architectures for identity described<br/>above, this sort will become quite effective.<br/>
RESULTS<br/>
In the last chapter, we saw that the unregulability of the Internet was a product<br/>of design: that the failure of that network to identify who someone is, what<br/>they’re doing, and where they’re from meant that it would be particularly<br/>difficult to enforce rules upon individuals using the network. Not impossible,<br/>but difficult. Not for all people, but for enough to matter. The Internet as it<br/>originally was gave everyone a “Ring of Gyges,” the ring which, as Plato reports<br/>in <i>The Republic, </i>made Gyges the shepherd invisible. The dilemma for regula-<br/>tion in such a world is precisely the fear Plato had about this ring: With such<br/>a ring, “no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would<br/>stand fast in justice.”25<br/>
And if such a man did choose justice, even with the power of the ring,<br/>
then “he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot,<br/>

60<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
although they would praise him to one another’s faces, and keep up appear-<br/>ances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.”<br/>
But these gaps in the Internet’s original design are not necessary. We can<br/>
imagine networks that interact seamlessly with the Internet but which don’t<br/>have these “imperfections.” And, more importantly, we can see why there<br/>would be an important commercial interest in eliminating these gaps.<br/>
Yet you may still be skeptical. Even if most Internet activity is traceable<br/>
using the technologies that I’ve described, you may still believe there are sig-<br/>nificant gaps. Indeed, the explosion of spam, viruses, ID theft, and the like are<br/>strong testimony to the fact that there’s still a lot of unregulable behavior.<br/>Commerce acting alone has not yet eliminated these threats, to both com-<br/>merce and civil life. For reasons I explore later in this book, it’s not even clear<br/>commerce could.<br/>
But commerce is not the only actor here. Government is also an impor-<br/>
tant ally, and the framework of regulability that commerce has built could be<br/>built on again by government.<br/>
Government can, in other words, help commerce and help itself. How it<br/>
does so is the subject of the chapter that follows.<br/>

COMMERCE HAS DONE ITS PART—FOR COMMERCE, AND INDIRECTLY, FOR<br/>governments. Technologies that make commerce more efficient are also<br/>technologies that make regulation simpler. The one supports the other.<br/>There are a host of technologies now that make it easier to know who some-<br/>one is on the Net, what they’re doing, and where they’re doing it. These<br/>technologies were built to make business work better. They make life on the<br/>Internet safer. But the by-product of these technologies is to make the Net<br/>more regulable.<br/>
<i>More </i>regulable. Not perfectly regulable. These tools alone do a great deal.<br/>
As Joel Reidenberg notes, they are already leading courts to recognize how<br/>behavior on the Net can be reached—and regulated.1 But they don’t yet create<br/>the incentives to build regulability into the heart of the Net. That final step<br/>will require action by the government.2<br/>
When I wrote the first version of this book, I certainly expected that the<br/>
government would eventually take these steps. Events since 1999—including<br/>the birth of Z-theory described below—have only increased my confidence. In<br/>the United States, the identification of “an enemy”—terrorism—has weak-<br/>ened the resolve to resist government action to make government more pow-<br/>erful and regulation more effective. There’s a limit, or at least I hope there is,<br/>but there is also no doubt that the line has been moved. And in any case,<br/>there is not much more that the government would need to do in order to<br/>radically increase the regulability of the net. These steps would not themselves<br/>excite any significant resistance. The government has the means, and the<br/>motive. This chapter maps the opportunity.<br/>
The trick is obvious once it is seen. It may well be difficult for the govern-<br/>
ment to regulate behavior directly, given the architecture of the Internet as it<br/>
61<br/>

62<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
is. But that doesn’t mean it is difficult for the government to regulate the<br/>architecture of the Internet as it is. The trick, then, is for the government to<br/>take steps that induce the development of an architecture that makes behavior<br/>more regulable.<br/>
In this context, I don’t mean by “architecture” the regulation of TCP/IP<br/>
itself. Instead, I simply mean regulation that changes the effective constraints<br/>of the architecture of the Internet, by altering the code at any layer within that<br/>space. If technologies of identification are lacking, then regulating the archi-<br/>tecture in this sense means steps the government can take to induce the<br/>deployment of technologies of identification.<br/>
If the government takes these steps, it will increase the regulability of<br/>
behavior on the Internet. And depending upon the substance of these steps<br/>taken, it could render the Internet the most perfectly regulable space we’ve<br/>known. As Michael Geist describes it, “governments may have been willing<br/>to step aside during the commercial Internet’s nascent years, but no<br/>longer.”3<br/>
REGULATING ARCHITECTURE: THE REGULATORY TWO-STEP<br/>
We can call this the “regulatory two-step”: In a context in which behavior is<br/>relatively unregulable, the government takes steps to increase regulability.<br/>And once framed, there are any number of examples that set the pattern for<br/>the two-step in cyberspace.<br/>
Car Congestion<br/>
London had a problem with traffic. There were too many cars in the central<br/>district, and there was no simple way to keep “unnecessary” cars out.<br/>
So London did three things. It first mandated a license plate that a video<br/>
camera could read, and then it installed video cameras on as many public<br/>fixtures as it would take to monitor—perpetually—what cars were where.<br/>
Then, beginning in February 2003, the city imposed a congestion tax:<br/>
Initially £5 per day (between 7 A.M. and 6:30 P.M.) for any car (save taxis and<br/>residents paying a special fee), raised to £8 in July 2005. After 18 months in<br/>operation, the system was working “better than expected.” Traffic delays were<br/>down 32 percent, traffic within the city was down 15 percent, and delays on<br/>main routes into the zones were down 20 percent. London is now exploring<br/>new technologies to make it even easier to charge for access more accurately.<br/>These include new tagging technologies, as well as GPS and GSM technologies<br/>that would monitor the car while within London.4<br/>

Telephones<br/>
The architecture of telephone networks has undergone a radical shift in the<br/>past decade. After resisting the design of the Internet for many years,5 tele-<br/>phone networks are now shifting from circuit-switched to packet-switched<br/>networks. As with the Internet, packets of information are spewed across the<br/>system, and nothing ensures that they will travel in the same way, or along the<br/>same path. Packets take the most efficient path, which depends on the<br/>demand at any one time.<br/>
This design, however, creates problems for law enforcement—in particular,<br/>
that part of law enforcement that depends upon wiretaps to do their job. In the<br/>circuit-switched network, it was relatively simple to identify which wires to tap.<br/>In the packet-switched network, where there are no predictable paths for pack-<br/>ets of data to travel, wiretapping becomes much more difficult.<br/>
At least it is difficult under one design of a packet-switched network. Dif-<br/>
ferent designs will be differently difficult. And that potential led Congress in<br/>1994 to enact the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act<br/>(CALEA). CALEA requires that networks be designed to preserve the ability<br/>of law enforcement to conduct electronic surveillance. This requirement has<br/>been negotiated in a series of “safe harbor” agreements that specify the stan-<br/>dards networks must meet to satisfy the requirements of the law.<br/>
CALEA is a classic example of the kind of regulation that I mean this<br/>
chapter to flag. The industry created one network architecture. That architec-<br/>ture didn’t adequately serve the interests of government. The response of the<br/>government was to regulate the design of the network so it better served the<br/>government’s ends. (Luckily for the networks, the government, at least ini-<br/>tially, agreed to pick up part of the cost.6) As Susan Crawford writes,<br/>
Most critically for the future of the Internet, law enforcement . . . has made clear<br/>
that it wants to ensure that it reviews all possibly relevant new services for com-<br/>
pliance with unstated information-gathering and information-forwarding<br/>
requirements before these services are launched. All prudent businesses will<br/>
want to run their services by law enforcement, suggests the DOJ: “Service<br/>
providers would be well advised to seek guidance early, preferably well before<br/>
deployment of a service, if they believe that their service is not covered by<br/>
CALEA. . . . DOJ would certainly consider a service provider’s failure to request<br/>
such guidance in any enforcement action.”7<br/>
CALEA is a “signal,” Crawford describes, that the “FCC may take the view<br/>
that permission will be needed from government authorities when designing<br/>

64<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
a wide variety of services, computers, and web sites that use the Internet pro-<br/>tocol. . . . [I]nformation flow membranes will be governmentally mandated as<br/>part of the design process for online products and services.”8 That hint has<br/>continued: In August 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)<br/>ruled that Voice-over-IP services “must be designed so as to make government<br/>wiretapping easier.”9<br/>
Of course, regulating the architecture of the network was not the only<br/>
means that Congress had. Congress could have compensated for any loss in<br/>crime prevention that resulted from the decreased ability to wiretap by<br/>increasing criminal punishments.10 Or Congress could have increased the<br/>resources devoted to criminal investigation. Both of these changes would have<br/>altered the incentives that criminals face without using the network’s potential<br/>to help track and convict criminals. But instead, Congress acted to change the<br/>architecture of the telephone networks, thus using the networks directly to<br/>change the incentives of criminals indirectly.<br/>
This is law regulating code. Its indirect effect is to improve law enforce-<br/>
ment, and it does so by modifying code-based constraints on law enforce-<br/>ment.<br/>
Regulation like this works well with telephone companies. There are few<br/>
companies, and the regulation is relatively easy to verify. Telephone companies<br/>are thus regulable intermediaries: Rules directed against them are likely to be<br/>enforced.<br/>
But what about when telephone service (or rather “telephone service”)<br/>
begins to be carried across the Internet? Vonage, or Skype, rather than Bell<br/>South? Are these entities similarly regulable?11<br/>
The answer is that they are, though for different reasons. Skype and Von-<br/>
age, as well as many other VOIP providers, seek to maximize their value as<br/>corporations. That value comes in part from demonstrating reliably regulable<br/>behavior. Failing to comply with the rules of the United States government is<br/>not a foundation upon which to build a healthy, profitable company. That’s as<br/>true for General Motors as it is for eBay.<br/>
Telephones: Part 2<br/>
Four years after Congress enacted CALEA, the FBI petitioned the Federal<br/>Communications Commission to enhance even further government’s power<br/>to regulate. Among the amendments the FBI proposed was a regulation<br/>designed to require disclosure of the locations of individuals using cellular<br/>phones by requiring the phone companies to report the cell tower from which<br/>the call was served.12 Cellular phone systems need this data to ensure seamless<br/>

regulating code<br/>
65<br/>
switching between transmitters. But beyond this and billing, the phone com-<br/>panies have no further need for this information.<br/>
The FBI, however, has interests beyond those of the companies. It would<br/>
like that data made available whenever it has a “legitimate law enforcement<br/>reason” for requesting it. The proposed amendment to CALEA would require<br/>the cellular company to provide this information, which is a way of indirectly<br/>requiring that it write its code to make the information retrievable.13<br/>
The original motivation for this requirement was reasonable enough:<br/>
Emergency service providers needed a simple way to determine where an<br/>emergency cellular phone call was coming from. Thus, revealing location<br/>data was necessary, at least in those cases. But the FBI was keen to extend<br/>the reach of location data beyond cases where someone was calling 911, so<br/>they pushed to require the collection of this information whenever a call is<br/>made.<br/>
So far, the FBI has been successful in its requests with the regulators but<br/>
less so with courts. But the limits the courts have imposed simply require the<br/>FBI to meet a high burden of proof to get access to the data. Whatever the<br/>standard, the effect of the regulation has been to force cell phone companies<br/>to build their systems to collect and preserve a kind of data that only aids the<br/>government.<br/>
Data Retention<br/>
Computers gather data about how they’re used. These data are collected in<br/>logs. The logs can be verbose or not—meaning they might gather lots of<br/>data, or little. And the more they gather, the easier it will be to trace who did<br/>what.<br/>
Governments are beginning to recognize this. And some are making<br/>
sure they can take advantage of it. The United States is beginning to<br/>“mull,”14 and the European Union has adopted, legislation to regulate “data<br/>generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly avail-<br/>able electronic communications,” by requiring that providers retain speci-<br/>fied data to better enable law enforcement. This includes data to determine<br/>the source, destination, time, duration, type, and equipment used in a given<br/>communication.15 Rules such as this will build a layer of traceability into the<br/>platform of electronic communication, making it easier for governments to<br/>track individual behavior. (By contrast, in 2006, Congressman Ed Markey of<br/>Massachusetts proposed legislation to forbid certain Internet companies,<br/>primarily search engines, from keeping logs that make Internet behavior<br/>traceable.16 We’ll see how far that proposed rule gets.)<br/>

66<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Encryption<br/>
The examples so far have involved regulations directed to code writers as a<br/>way indirectly to change behavior. But sometimes, the government is doubly<br/>indirect: Sometimes it creates market incentives as a way to change code writ-<br/>ing, so that the code writing will indirectly change behavior. An example is the<br/>U.S. government’s failed attempt to secure Clipper as the standard for encryp-<br/>tion technology.17<br/>
I have already sketched the Janus-faced nature of encryption: The same<br/>
technology enables both confidentiality and identification. The government<br/>is concerned with the confidentiality part. Encryption allows individuals to<br/>make their conversations or data exchanges untranslatable except by someone<br/>with a key. How untranslatable is a matter of debate,18 but we can put that<br/>debate aside for the moment, because, regardless, it is too untranslatable for<br/>the government’s liking. So the government sought to control the use of<br/>encryption technology by getting the Clipper chip accepted as a standard for<br/>encryption.<br/>
The mechanics of the Clipper chip are not easily summarized, but its aim<br/>
was to encourage encryption technologies that left a back door open for the<br/>government.19 A conversation could be encrypted so that others could not<br/>understand it, but the government would have the ability (in most cases with<br/>a court order) to decrypt the conversation using a special key.<br/>
The question for the government then was how it could spread the Clip-<br/>
per chip technology. At first, the Clinton administration thought that the best<br/>way was simply to ban all other encryption technology. This strategy proved<br/>very controversial, so the government then fixed on a different technique: It<br/>subsidized the development and deployment of the Clipper chip.20<br/>
The thinking was obvious: If the government could get industry to use<br/>
Clipper by making Clipper the cheapest technology, then it could indirectly<br/>regulate the use of encryption. The market would do the regulation for the<br/>government.21<br/>
The subsidy plan failed. Skepticism about the quality of the code itself,<br/>
and about the secrecy with which it had been developed, as well as strong<br/>opposition to any governmentally directed encryption regime (especially a<br/>U.S.-sponsored regime), led most to reject the technology. This forced the<br/>government to take another path.<br/>
That alternative is for our purposes the most interesting. For a time, some<br/>
were pushing for authority to regulate authors of encryption code directly—<br/>with a requirement that they build into their code a back door through which<br/>the government could gain access.22 While the proposals have been various,<br/>

regulating code<br/>
67<br/>
they all aim at ensuring that the government has a way to crack whatever<br/>encryption code a user selects.<br/>
Compared with other strategies—banning the use of encryption or<br/>
flooding the market with an alternative encryption standard—this mode<br/>presents a number of advantages.<br/>
First, unlike banning the use of encryption, this mode of regulation does not<br/>
directly interfere with the rights of use by individuals. It therefore is not vulner-<br/>able to a strong, if yet unproven constitutional claim that an individual has a<br/>right “to speak through encryption.” It aims only to change the mix of encryption<br/>technologies available, not to control directly any particular use by an individual.<br/>State regulation of the writing of encryption code is just like state regulation of<br/>the design of automobiles: Individual use is not regulated. Second, unlike the<br/>technique of subsidizing one market solution, this solution allows the market to<br/>compete to provide the best encryption system, given this regulatory constraint.<br/>Finally, unlike both other solutions, this one involves the regulation of only a rel-<br/>atively small number of actors, since manufacturers of encryption technology are<br/>far fewer in number than users or buyers of encryption systems.<br/>
Like the other examples in this section, then, this solution is an example<br/>
of the government regulating code directly so as to better regulate behavior<br/>indirectly; the government uses the architecture of the code to reach a partic-<br/>ular substantive end. Here the end, as with digital telephony, is to ensure that<br/>the government’s ability to search certain conversations is not blocked by<br/>emerging technology. And again, the government pursues that end not by<br/>regulating primary behavior but by regulating the conditions under which<br/>primary behavior happens.<br/>
REGULATING CODE TO INCREASE REGULABILITY<br/>
All five of these examples address a behavior that the government wants to<br/>regulate, but which it cannot (easily) regulate directly. In all five, the govern-<br/>ment thus regulates that behavior indirectly by directly regulating technolo-<br/>gies that affect that behavior. Those regulated technologies in turn influence<br/>or constrain the targeted behavior differently. They “influence the develop-<br/>ment of code.”23 They are regulations of code that in turn make behavior<br/>more regulable.<br/>
The question that began this chapter was whether there were similar ways<br/>
that the government might regulate code on the Internet to make behavior on<br/>the Net more regulable. The answer is obviously yes. There are many steps the<br/>government might take to make behavior on the network more regulable,<br/>and there are obvious reasons for taking those steps.<br/>

68<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
If done properly, these steps would reduce and isolate untraceable Inter-<br/>
net behavior. That in turn would increase the probability that bad behavior<br/>would be detected. Increased detection would significantly reduce the<br/>expected return from maliciousness. For some significant range of malevolent<br/>actors, that shift would drive their bad behavior elsewhere.<br/>
This would not work perfectly, of course. No effort of control could ever<br/>
be perfect in either assuring traceability or tracking misbehavior. But perfec-<br/>tion is not the standard. The question is whether the government could put<br/>enough incentives into the mix of the network to induce a shift towards trace-<br/>ability as a default. For obvious reasons, again, the answer is yes.<br/>
The General Form<br/>
If the government’s aim is to facilitate traceability, that can be achieved by<br/>attaching an identity to actors on the network. One conceivable way to do that<br/>would be to require network providers to block actions by individuals not dis-<br/>playing a government-issued ID. That strategy, however, is unlikely, as it is<br/>politically impossible. Americans are antsy enough about a national identity<br/>card;24 they are not likely to be interested in an Internet identity card.<br/>
But even if the government can’t <i>force </i>cyber citizens to carry IDs, it is not<br/>
difficult to create strong <i>incentives </i>for individuals to carry IDs. There is no<br/>requirement that all citizens have a driver’s license, but you would find it very<br/>hard to get around without one, even if you do not drive. The government<br/>does not require that you keep state-issued identification on your person, but<br/>if you want to fly to another city, you must show at least one form of it. The<br/>point is obvious: Make the incentive to carry ID so strong that it tips the nor-<br/>mal requirements of interacting on the Net.<br/>
In the same way, the government could create incentives to enable digital<br/>
IDs, not by regulating individuals directly but by regulating intermediaries.<br/>Intermediaries are fewer, their interests are usually commercial, and they are<br/>ordinarily pliant targets of regulation. ISPs will be the “most important and<br/>obvious” targets—“focal points of Internet control.”25<br/>
Consider first the means the government has to induce the spread of<br/>
“digital IDs.” I will then describe more what these “digital IDs” would have to<br/>be.<br/>
First, government means:<br/>
• Sites on the Net have the ability to condition access based on whether someone car-<br/>
ries the proper credential. The government has the power to require sites to impose<br/>
this condition. For example, the state could require that gambling sites check the<br/>

regulating code<br/>
69<br/>
age and residency of anyone trying to use the site. Many sites could be required to<br/>
check the citizenship of potential users, or any number of other credentials. As<br/>
more and more sites complied with this requirement, individuals would have a<br/>
greater and greater incentive to carry the proper credentials. The more credentials<br/>
they carried, the easier it would be to impose regulations on them.26<br/>
• The government could give a tax break to anyone who filed his or her income tax<br/>
with a proper credential.<br/>
• The government could impose a 10 percent Internet sales tax and then exempt<br/>
anyone who purchased goods with a certificate that authenticated their state of<br/>
residence; the state would then be able to collect whatever local tax applied when<br/>
it was informed of the purchase.27<br/>
• The government could charge users for government publications unless they<br/>
gained access to the site with a properly authenticated certificate.<br/>
• As in other Western democracies, the government could mandate voting28—<br/>
and then establish Internet voting; voters would come to the virtual polls with<br/>
a digital identity that certified them as registered.<br/>
• The government could make credit card companies liable for the full cost of<br/>
any credit card or debit card online fraud whenever the transaction was<br/>
processed without a qualified ID.<br/>
• The government could require the establishment of a secure registry of e-mail<br/>
servers that would be used to fight spam. That list would encourage others to<br/>
begin to require some further level of authentication before sending e-mail.<br/>
That authentication could be supplied by a digital ID.<br/>
The effect of each of these strategies would be to increase the prevalence<br/>
of digital IDs. And at some point, there would be a tipping. There is an obvi-<br/>ous benefit to many on the Net to be able to increase confidence about the<br/>entity with whom they are dealing. These digital IDs would be a tool to<br/>increase that confidence. Thus, even if a site permits itself to be accessed with-<br/>out any certification by the user, any step beyond that initial contact could<br/>require carrying the proper ID. The norm would be to travel in cyberspace<br/>with an ID; those who refuse would find the cyberspace that they could<br/>inhabit radically reduced.<br/>
The consequence of this tipping would be to effectively stamp every<br/>
action on the Internet—at a minimum—with a kind of digital fingerprint.<br/>That fingerprint—at a minimum—would enable authorities to trace any<br/>action back to the party responsible for it. That tracing—at a minimum—<br/>could require judicial oversight before any trace could be effected. And that<br/>oversight—at a minimum—could track the ordinary requirements of the<br/>Fourth Amendment.<br/>

70<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
At a minimum. For the critical part in this story is not that the govern-<br/>
ment could induce an ID-rich Internet. Obviously it could. Instead, the<br/>important question is the kind of ID-rich Internet the government<br/>induces.<br/>
Compare two very different sorts of digital IDs, both of which we can<br/>
understand in terms of the “wallet” metaphor used in Chapter 4 to describe<br/>the evolving technology of identity that Microsoft is helping to lead.<br/>
One sort of ID would work like this: Every time you need to identify<br/>
yourself, you turn over your wallet. The party demanding identification rum-<br/>mages through the wallet, gathering whatever data he wants.<br/>
The second sort of ID works along the lines of the Identity Layer<br/>
described in Chapter 4: When you need to identify yourself, you can provide<br/>the minimal identification necessary. So if you need to certify that you’re an<br/>American, only that bit gets revealed. Or if you need to certify that you’re<br/>over 18, only that fact gets revealed.<br/>
On the model of the second form of the digital ID, it becomes possible to<br/>
imagine then an ultra-minimal ID—an identification that reveals nothing on<br/>its face, but facilitates traceability. Again, a kind of digital fingerprint which is<br/>meaningless unless decoded, and, once decoded, links back to a responsible<br/>agent.<br/>
These two architectures stand at opposite ends of a spectrum. They<br/>
produce radically different consequences for privacy and anonymity. Per-<br/>fect anonymity is possible with neither; the minimal effect of both is to<br/>make behavior traceable. But with the second mode, that traceability itself<br/>can be heavily regulated. Thus, there should be no possible traceability<br/>when the only action at issue is protected speech. And where a trace is to be<br/>permitted, it should only be permitted if authorized by proper judicial<br/>action. Thus the system would preserve the capacity to identify who did<br/>what when, but it would only realize that capacity under authorized cir-<br/>cumstances.<br/>
The difference between these two ID-enabled worlds, then, is all the dif-<br/>
ference in the world. And critically, which world we get depends completely<br/>upon the values that guide the development of this architecture. ID-type 1<br/>would be a disaster for privacy as well as security. ID-type 2 could radically<br/>increase privacy, as well as security, for all except those whose behavior can<br/>legitimately be tracked.<br/>
Now, the feasibility of the government effecting either ID depends cru-<br/>
cially upon the target of regulation. It depends upon there being an entity<br/>responsible for the code that individuals use, and it requires that these entities<br/>can be effectively regulated. Is this assumption really true? The government<br/>

regulating code<br/>
71<br/>
may be able to regulate the telephone companies, but can it regulate a diver-<br/>sity of code writers? In particular, can it regulate code writers who are com-<br/>mitted to resisting precisely such regulation?<br/>
In a world where the code writers were the sort of people who governed<br/>
the Internet Engineering Task Force29 of a few years ago, the answer is prob-<br/>ably no. The underpaid heroes who built the Net have ideological reasons to<br/>resist government’s mandate. They were not likely to yield to its threats. Thus,<br/>they would provide an important check on the government’s power over the<br/>architectures of cyberspace.<br/>
But as code writing becomes commercial—as it becomes the product of<br/>
a smaller number of large companies—the government’s ability to regulate it<br/>increases. The more money there is at stake, the less inclined businesses (and<br/>their backers) are to bear the costs of promoting an ideology.<br/>
The best example is the history of encryption. From the very start of the<br/>
debate over the government’s control of encryption, techies have argued that<br/>such regulations are silly. Code can always be exported; bits know no borders.<br/>So the idea that a law of Congress would control the flow of code was, these<br/>people argued, absurd.<br/>
The fact is, however, that the regulations had a substantial effect. Not on<br/>
the techies—who could easily get encryption technologies from any number<br/>of places on the Net—but on the businesses writing software that would<br/>incorporate such technology. Netscape or IBM was not about to build and sell<br/>software in violation of U.S. regulations. The United States has a fairly pow-<br/>erful threat against these two companies. As the techies predicted, regulation<br/>did not control the flow of bits. But it did quite substantially inhibit the devel-<br/>opment of software that would use these bits.30<br/>
The effect has been profound. Companies that were once bastions of<br/>
unregulability are now becoming producers of technologies that facilitate<br/>regulation. For example, Network Associates, inheritor of the encryption pro-<br/>gram PGP, was originally a strong opponent of regulation of encryption; now<br/>it offers products that facilitate corporate control of encryption and recovery<br/>of keys.31 Key recovery creates a corporate back door, which, in many contexts,<br/>is far less restricted than a governmental back door.<br/>
Cisco is a second example.32 In 1998 Cisco announced a router product<br/>
that would enable an ISP to encrypt Internet traffic at the link level—between<br/>gateways, that is.33 But this router would also have a switch that would disable<br/>the encryption of the router data and facilitate the collection of unencrypted<br/>Internet traffic. This switch could be flipped at the government’s command;<br/>in other words, the data would be encrypted only when the government<br/>allowed it to be.<br/>

72<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
The point in both cases is that the government is a player in the market<br/>
for software. It affects the market both by creating rules and by purchasing<br/>products. Either way, it influences the supply of commercial software<br/>providers who exist to provide what the market demands.<br/>
Veterans of the early days of the Net might ask these suppliers, “How<br/>
could you?”<br/>
“It’s just business,” is the obvious reply.<br/>
EAST COAST AND WEST COAST CODES<br/>
Throughout this section, I’ve been speaking of two sorts of code. One is the<br/>“code” that Congress enacts (as in the tax code or “the U.S. Code”). Congress<br/>passes an endless array of statutes that say in words how to behave. Some<br/>statutes direct people; others direct companies; some direct bureaucrats. The<br/>technique is as old as government itself: using commands to control. In our<br/>country, it is a primarily East Coast (Washington, D.C.) activity. Call it “East<br/>Coast Code.”<br/>
The other is the code that code writers “enact”—the instructions imbed-<br/>
ded in the software and hardware that make cyberspace work. This is code in<br/>its modern sense. It regulates in the ways I’ve begun to describe. The code of<br/>Net95, for example, regulated to disable centralized control; code that encrypts<br/>regulates to protect privacy. In our country (MIT excepted), this kind of code<br/>writing is increasingly a West Coast (Silicon Valley, Redmond) activity. We can<br/>call it “West Coast Code.”<br/>
West Coast and East Coast Code can get along perfectly when they’re not<br/>
paying much attention to each other. Each, that is, can regulate within its own<br/>domain. But the story of this chapter is “When East Meets West”: what happens<br/>when East Coast Code recognizes how West Coast Code affects regulability,<br/>and when East Coast Code sees how it might interact with West Coast Code to<br/>induce it to regulate differently.<br/>
This interaction has changed. The power of East Coast Code over West<br/>
Coast Code has increased. When software was the product of hackers and indi-<br/>viduals located outside of any institution of effective control (for example, the<br/>University of Illinois or MIT), East Coast Code could do little to control West<br/>Coast Code.34 But as code has become the product of companies, the power of<br/>East Coast Code has increased. When commerce writes code, then code can be<br/>controlled, because commercial entities can be controlled. Thus, the power of<br/>East over West increases as West Coast Code becomes increasingly commercial.<br/>
There is a long history of power moving west. It tells of the clash of ways<br/>
between the old and the new. The pattern is familiar. The East reaches out to<br/>

regulating code<br/>
73<br/>
control the West; the West resists. But that resistance is never complete. Values<br/>from the East become integrated with the West. The new takes on a bit of the<br/>old.<br/>
That is precisely what is happening on the Internet. When West Coast<br/>
Code was born, there was little in its DNA that cared at all about East Coast<br/>Code concerns. The Internet’s aim was end-to-end communication. Regula-<br/>tion at the middle was simply disabled.<br/>
Over time, the concerns of East Coast Coders have become much more<br/>
salient. Everyone hates the pathologies of the Internet—viruses, ID theft, and<br/>spam, to pick the least controversial. That universal hatred has warmed West<br/>Coast Coders to finding a remedy. They are now primed for the influence<br/>East Coast Code requires: adding complements to the Internet architecture<br/>that will bring regulability to the Net.<br/>
Now, some will continue to resist my claim that the government can<br/>
effect a regulable Net. This resistance has a common form: Even if architec-<br/>tures of identification emerge, and even if they become common, there is<br/>nothing to show that they will become universal, and nothing to show that at<br/>any one time they could not be evaded. Individuals can always work around<br/>these technologies of identity. No control that they could effect would ever be<br/>perfect.<br/>
True. The control of an ID-rich Internet would never be complete. There<br/>
will always be ways to escape.<br/>
But there is an important fallacy lurking in the argument: Just because<br/>
perfect control is not possible does not mean that effective control is not pos-<br/>sible. Locks can be picked, but that does not mean locks are useless. In the<br/>context of the Internet, even partial control would have powerful effects.<br/>
A fundamental principle of bovinity is operating here and elsewhere.<br/>
Tiny controls, consistently enforced, are enough to direct very large animals.<br/>The controls of a certificate-rich Internet are tiny, I agree. But we are large ani-<br/>mals. I think it is as likely that the majority of people would resist these small<br/>but efficient regulators of the Net as it is that cows would resist wire fences.<br/>This is who we are, and this is why these regulations work.<br/>
So imagine the world in which we all could simply establish our creden-<br/>
tials simply by looking into a camera or swiping our finger on a thumbprint<br/>reader. In a second, without easily forgotten passwords, or easily forged<br/>authentication, we get access to the Net, with all of the attributes that are<br/>ours, reliably and simply assertable.<br/>
What will happen then? When you can choose between remembering a<br/>
pass-phrase, typing it every time you want access to your computer, and sim-<br/>ply using your thumb to authenticate who you are? Or if not your thumb,<br/>

74<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
then your iris, or whatever body part turns out to be cheapest to certify?<br/>When it is easiest simply to give identity up, will anyone resist?<br/>
If this is selling your soul, then trust that there are truly wonderful bene-<br/>
fits to be had. Imagine a world where all your documents exist on the Internet<br/>in a “virtual private network,” accessible by you from any machine on the Net<br/>and perfectly secured by a biometric key.35 You could sit at any machine, call<br/>up your documents, do your work, answer your e-mail, and move on—every-<br/>thing perfectly secure and safe, locked up by a key certified by the markings in<br/>your eye.<br/>
This is the easiest and most efficient architecture to imagine. And it comes<br/>
at (what some think) is a very low price—authentication. Just say who you<br/>are, plug into an architecture that certifies facts about you, give your identity<br/>away, and all this could be yours.<br/>
Z-THEORY<br/>
“So, like, it didn’t happen, Lessig. You said in 1999 that commerce and govern-<br/>ment would work together to build the perfectly regulable net. As I look<br/>through my spam-infested inbox, while my virus checker runs in the back-<br/>ground, I wonder what you think now. Whatever was possible hasn’t hap-<br/>pened. Doesn’t that show that you’re wrong?”<br/>
So writes a friend to me as I began this project to update <i>Code </i>v1<i>. </i>And<br/>
while I never actually said anything about <i>when </i>the change I was predicting<br/>would happen, there is something in the criticism. The theory of <i>Code </i>v1 is<br/>missing a part: Whatever incentives there are to push in small ways to the<br/>perfectly regulable Net, the theory doesn’t explain what would motivate the<br/>final push. What gets us over the tipping point?<br/>
The answer is not fully written, but its introduction was published this<br/>
year. In May 2006, the <i>Harvard Law Review </i>gave Professor Jonathan Zittrain<br/>(hence “Z-theory”) 67 pages to explain “The Generative Internet.”36 The arti-<br/>cle is brilliant; the book will be even better; and the argument is the missing<br/>piece in <i>Code </i>v1.<br/>
Much of <i>The Generative Internet </i>will be familiar to readers of this book.<br/>
General-purpose computers plus an end-to-end network, Zittrain argues,<br/>have produced an extraordinarily innovative (“generative”) platform for<br/>invention. We celebrate the good stuff this platform has produced. But we (I<br/>especially) who so celebrate don’t pay enough attention to the bad. For the<br/>very same design that makes it possible for an Indian immigrant to invent<br/>HoTMaiL, or Stanford dropouts to create Google, also makes it possible for<br/>malcontents and worse to create viruses and worse. These sorts use the<br/>

regulating code<br/>
75<br/>
generative Internet to generate evil. And as Zittrain rightly observes, we’ve just<br/>begun to see the evil this malware will produce. Consider just a few of his<br/>examples:<br/>
• In 2003, in a test designed to measure the sophistication of spammers in finding<br/>
“open relay” servers through which they could send their spam undetected,<br/>
within 10 hours spammers had found the server. Within 66 hours they had sent<br/>
more than 3.3 million messages to 229,468 people.37<br/>
• In 2004, the Sasser worm was able to compromise more than 500,000 comput-<br/>
ers—in just 3 days.38 The year before, the Slammer worm infected 90 percent of<br/>
a particular Microsoft server—in just 15 minutes.39<br/>
• In 2003, the SoBig.F e-mail virus accounted for almost 70 percent of the e-mails<br/>
sent while it was spreading. More than 23.2 million messages were sent to AOL<br/>
users alone.40<br/>
These are of course not isolated events. They are instead part of a growing<br/>
pattern. As the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team calculates, there<br/>has been an explosion of security incidents reported to CERT. Here is the<br/>graph Zittrain produced from the data:41<br/>
Number of Security Incidents Reported to CERT/CC, 1988-2003<br/>
160,000<br/>
140,000<br/>
120,000<br/>

76<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
The graph ends in 2004 because CERT concluded that the incidents were<br/>
so “commonplace and widespread as to be indistinguishable from one<br/>another.”42<br/>
That there is malware on the Internet isn’t surprising. That it is growing<br/>
isn’t surprising either. What is surprising is that, so far at least, this malware<br/>has not been as destructive as it could be. Given the ability of malware authors<br/>to get their malicious code on many machines very quickly, why haven’t more<br/>tried to do real harm?<br/>
For example, imagine a worm that worked itself onto a million machines,<br/>
and in a synchronized attack, simultaneously deleted the hard drive of all<br/>million machines. Zittrain’s point is not that this is easy, but rather, that it is<br/>just as difficult as the kind of worms that are already successfully spreading<br/>themselves everywhere. So why doesn’t one of the malicious code writers do<br/>real damage? What’s stopping cyber-Armageddon?<br/>
The answer is that there’s no good answer. And when there’s no good<br/>
explanation for why something hasn’t happened yet, there’s good reason to<br/>worry that it will happen. And when this happens—when a malware author<br/>produces a really devastatingly destructive worm—that will trigger the polit-<br/>ical resolve to do what so far governments have not done: push to complete<br/>the work of transforming the Net into a regulable space.<br/>
This is the crucial (and once you see it, obvious) insight of Z-theory. Ter-<br/>
ror motivates radical change. Think about, for example, the changes in law<br/>enforcement (and the protection of civil rights) effected by the “Patriot Act.”43<br/>This massively extensive piece of legislation was enacted 45 days after the ter-<br/>ror attacks on 9/11. But most of that bill had been written long before 9/11.<br/>The authors knew that until there was a serious terrorist attack, there would<br/>be insufficient political will to change law enforcement significantly. But once<br/>the trigger of 9/11 was pulled, radical change was possible.<br/>
The same will be true of the Internet. The malware we’ve seen so far has<br/>
caused great damage. We’ve suffered this damage as annoyance rather than<br/>threat. But when the Internet’s equivalent of 9/11 happens—whether spon-<br/>sored by “terrorists” or not—annoyance will mature into political will. And<br/>that political will will produce real change.<br/>
Zittrain’s aim is to prepare us for that change. His powerful and extensive<br/>
analysis works through the trade-offs we could make as we change the Inter-<br/>net into something less generative. And while his analysis is worthy of a book<br/>of its own, I’ll let him write it. My goal in pointing to it here is to provide an<br/>outline to an answer that plugs the hole in the theory of <i>Code </i>v1. <i>Code </i>v1<br/>described the means. Z-theory provides the motive.<br/>

There was an awful movie released in 1996 called <i>Independence Day. </i>The<br/>story is about an invasion by aliens. When the aliens first appear, many earth-<br/>lings are eager to welcome them. For these idealists, there is no reason to<br/>assume hostility, and so a general joy spreads among the hopeful across the<br/>globe in reaction to what before had seemed just a dream: really cool alien life.<br/>
Soon after the aliens appear, however, and well into the celebration, the<br/>
mood changes. Quite suddenly, Earth’s leaders realize that the intentions of<br/>these aliens are not at all friendly. Indeed, they are quite hostile. Within a very<br/>short time of this realization, Earth is captured. (Only Jeff Goldblum realizes<br/>what’s going on beforehand, but he always gets it first.)<br/>
My story here is similar (though I hope not as awful). We have been as<br/>
welcoming and joyous about the Net as the earthlings were about the aliens in<br/><i>Independence Day; </i>we have accepted its growth in our lives without ques-<br/>tioning its final effect. But at some point, we too will come to see a potential<br/>threat. We will see that cyberspace does not guarantee its own freedom but<br/>instead carries an extraordinary potential for control. And then we will ask:<br/>How should we respond?<br/>
I have spent many pages making a point that some may find obvious.<br/>
But I have found that, for some reason, the people for whom this point should<br/>be most important do not get it. Too many take this freedom as nature. Too<br/>many believe liberty will take care of itself. Too many miss how different<br/>architectures embed different values, and that only by selecting these different<br/>architectures—these different codes—can we establish and promote our val-<br/>ues.<br/>
Now it should be apparent why I began this book with an account of the<br/>
rediscovery of the role for self-government, or control, that has marked recent<br/>history in post-Communist Europe. Market forces encourage architectures of<br/>identity to facilitate online commerce. Government needs to do very little—<br/>indeed, nothing at all—to induce just this sort of development. The market<br/>forces are too powerful; the potential here is too great. If anything is certain,<br/>it is that an architecture of identity will develop on the Net—and thereby<br/>fundamentally transform its regulability.<br/>
But isn’t it clear that government should do something to make this archi-<br/>
tecture consistent with important public values? If commerce is going to<br/>define the emerging architectures of cyberspace, isn’t the role of government<br/>to ensure that those public values that are not in commerce’s interest are also<br/>built into the architecture?<br/>
Architecture is a kind of law: It determines what people can and cannot<br/>
do. When commercial interests determine the architecture, they create a kind<br/>of privatized law. I am not against private enterprise; my strong presumption<br/>

78<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
in most cases is to let the market produce. But isn’t it absolutely clear that<br/>there must be limits to this presumption? That public values are not<br/>exhausted by the sum of what IBM might desire? That what is good for Amer-<br/>ica Online is not necessarily good for America?<br/>
Ordinarily, when we describe competing collections of values, and the<br/>
choices we make among them, we call these choices “political.” They are<br/>choices about how the world will be ordered and about which values will be<br/>given precedence.<br/>
Choices among values, choices about regulation, about control, choices<br/>
about the definition of spaces of freedom—all this is the stuff of politics.<br/>Code codifies values, and yet, oddly, most people speak as if code were just a<br/>question of engineering. Or as if code is best left to the market. Or best left<br/>unaddressed by government.<br/>
But these attitudes are mistaken. Politics is that process by which we col-<br/>
lectively decide how we should live. That is not to say it is a space where we<br/>collectivize—a collective can choose a libertarian form of government. The<br/>point is not the substance of the choice. The point about politics is process.<br/>Politics is the process by which we reason about how things ought to be.<br/>
Two decades ago, in a powerful trilogy drawing together a movement in<br/>
legal theory, Roberto Unger preached that “it’s all politics.”44 He meant that we<br/>should not accept that any part of what defines the world is removed from<br/>politics—everything should be considered “up for grabs” and subject to<br/>reform.<br/>
Many believed Unger was arguing that we should put everything up for<br/>
grabs all the time, that nothing should be certain or fixed, that everything<br/>should be in constant flux. But that is not what he meant.<br/>
His meaning was instead just this: That we should interrogate the neces-<br/>
sities of any particular social order and ask whether they are in fact necessities,<br/>and we should demand that those necessities justify the powers that they<br/>order. As Bruce Ackerman puts it, we must ask of every exercise of power:<br/>Why?45 Perhaps not exactly at the moment when the power is exercised, but<br/>sometime.<br/>
“Power,” in this account, is just another word for constraints that humans<br/>
can do something about. Meteors crashing to earth are not “power” within the<br/>domain of “it’s all politics.” Where the meteor hits is not politics, though the<br/>consequences may well be. Where it hits, instead, is nothing we can do any-<br/>thing about.<br/>
But the architecture of cyberspace is power in this sense; how it is could<br/>
be different. Politics is about how we decide, how that power is exercised, and<br/>by whom.<br/>

regulating code<br/>
79<br/>
If code is law, then, as William Mitchell writes, “control of code is power”:<br/>
“For citizens of cyberspace, . . . code . . . is becoming a crucial focus of political<br/>contest. Who shall write that software that increasingly structures our daily<br/>lives?”46 As the world is now, code writers are increasingly lawmakers. They<br/>determine what the defaults of the Internet will be; whether privacy will be<br/>protected; the degree to which anonymity will be allowed; the extent to which<br/>access will be guaranteed. They are the ones who set its nature. Their deci-<br/>sions, now made in the interstices of how the Net is coded, define what the<br/>Net is.<br/>
How the code regulates, who the code writers are, and who controls the<br/>
code writers—these are questions on which any practice of justice must focus<br/>in the age of cyberspace. The answers reveal how cyberspace is regulated. My<br/>claim in this part of the book is that cyberspace is regulated by its code, and<br/>that the code is changing. Its regulation is its code, and its code is changing.<br/>
We are entering an age when the power of regulation will be relocated to<br/>
a structure whose properties and possibilities are fundamentally different. As<br/>I said about Russia at the start of this book, one form of power may be<br/>destroyed, but another is taking its place.<br/>
Our aim must be to understand this power and to ask whether it is prop-<br/>
erly exercised. As David Brin asks, “If we admire the Net, should not a burden<br/>of proof fall on those who would change the basic assumptions that brought<br/>it about in the first place?”47<br/>
These “basic assumptions” were grounded in liberty and openness. An<br/>
invisible hand now threatens both. We need to understand how.<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
One example of the developing struggle over cyber freedoms is the still-not-<br/>free China. The Chinese government has taken an increasingly aggressive<br/>stand against behavior in cyberspace that violates real-space norms. Purveyors<br/>of porn get 10 years in jail. Critics of the government get the same. If this is<br/>the people’s republic, this is the people’s tough love.<br/>
To make these prosecutions possible, the Chinese need the help of net-<br/>
work providers. And local law requires that network providers in China help.<br/>So story after story now reports major network providers—including Yahoo!<br/>and Microsoft—helping the government do the sort of stuff that would make<br/>our Constitution cringe.<br/>
The extremes are bad enough. But the more revealing example of the<br/>
pattern I’m describing here is Google. Google is (rightly) famous for its fan-<br/>tastic search engine. Its brand has been built on the idea that no irrelevant fac-<br/>tor controls its search results. Companies can buy search words, but their<br/>results are bracketed and separate from the main search results. The central<br/>

80<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
search results—that part of the screen your eyes instinctively go to—are not<br/>to be tampered with.<br/>
Unless the company seeking to tamper with the results is China, Inc. For<br/>
China, Google has promised to build a special routine.48 Sites China wants to<br/>block won’t appear in the Google.CN search engine. No notice will be pre-<br/>sented. No system will inform searchers that the search results they are read-<br/>ing have been filtered by Chinese censors. Instead, to the Chinese viewer, this<br/>will look like normal old Google. And because Google is so great, the Chinese<br/>government knows most will be driven to Google, even if Google filters what<br/>the government doesn’t want its people to have.<br/>
Here is the perfect dance of commerce with government. Google can<br/>
build the technology the Chinese need to make China’s regulation more per-<br/>fectly enabled, and China can extract that talent from Google by mandating<br/>it as a condition of being in China’s market.<br/>
The value of that market is thus worth more to Google than the value of<br/>
its “neutral search” principle. Or at least, it better be, if this deal makes any<br/>sense.<br/>
My purpose here is not to criticize Google—or Microsoft, or Yahoo!<br/>
These companies have stockholders; maximizing corporate value is their<br/>charge. Were I running any of these companies, I’m not sure I would have<br/>acted differently.<br/>
But that in the end is my point: Commerce has a purpose, and govern-<br/>
ment can exploit that to its own end. It will, increasingly and more frequently,<br/>and when it does, the character of the Net will change.<br/>
Radically so.<br/>

P A R T<br/>

The lesson of the last part was that the interaction between commerce and<br/>government will change the effective architecture of the Internet. That change<br/>will increase the regulability of behavior on the Internet. Powder will be<br/>sprayed on the invisible men of cyberspace, and after the spray, their exploits<br/>will be more easily known.<br/>
But so far my story has not changed the basic mode by which government<br/>
regulates. So far, the government threatens punishment, and that threat is<br/>intended to create the incentive for individuals to obey the government’s rule.<br/>The changes in the effective architecture of cyberspace that I have described<br/>would simply make it easier for the state to make good on its threat, and that<br/>would reduce the expected value of criminal behavior (preferably below zero).<br/>Traceability will increase effective enforcement; effective enforcement will<br/>increase the costs of deviating from a state-specified rule.<br/>
In this part, I consider a different kind of regulation. The question here is<br/>
not how the architecture of the Net will make it easier for traditional regula-<br/>tion to happen. The issue here is how the architecture of the Net—or its<br/>“code”—itself becomes a regulator. In this context, the rule applied to an<br/>individual does not find its force from the threat of consequences enforced by<br/>the law—fines, jail, or even shame. Instead, the rule is applied to an individual<br/>

82<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
through a kind of physics. A locked door is not a command “do not enter”<br/>backed up with the threat of punishment by the state. A locked door is a<br/>physical constraint on the liberty of someone to enter some space.<br/>
My claim is that this form of regulation will become increasingly com-<br/>
mon in cyberspace. And it has, moreover, a distinctive and often counter-<br/>intuitive character. The aim of this part is to explore this distinctive mode of<br/>regulation as a step to understanding more systematically the interaction<br/>between technology and policy.<br/>

S I X<br/>
c y b e r s p a c e s<br/>
I’VE SAID WE CAN DISTINGUISH THE INTERNET FROM CYBERSPACE. TO MAKE THE<br/>distinctive form of regulation that is the subject of this part salient, we need<br/>to say a bit more about this distinction. The Internet is a medium of commu-<br/>nication. People do things “on” the Internet. Most of those things are trivial,<br/>even if important. People pay bills on the Internet, they make reservations at<br/>restaurants. They get their news from the Internet. They send news to family<br/>members using e-mail or IM chat. These uses are important in the sense that<br/>they affect the economy and make life easier and harder for those using the<br/>Internet. But they’re not important in the sense that they change how people<br/>live. It’s very cool that you can buy books with one click at Amazon. I buy tons<br/>(maybe literally) of books I wouldn’t otherwise have bought. But my life has<br/>not been changed by one-click (even if my bank account has). It’s been made<br/>easier and more literate, but not anything fundamentally different.<br/>
Cyberspace, by contrast, is not just about making life easier. It is about<br/>
making life different, or perhaps better. It is about making a different (or sec-<br/>ond) life. It evokes, or calls to life, ways of interacting that were not possible<br/>before. I don’t mean that the interaction is new—we’ve always had commu-<br/>nities; these communities have always produced something close to what I will<br/>describe cyberspace to have produced. But these cyberspace communities cre-<br/>ate a difference in degree that has matured into a difference in kind. There is<br/>something unique about the interactions in these spaces, and something espe-<br/>cially unique about how they are regulated.<br/>
Life in cyberspace is regulated primarily through the code of cyberspace.<br/>
Not regulated in the sense of Part I—my point is not that the code makes it<br/>easy to know who did what so that penalties can be visited upon those who<br/>behaved badly. Regulated in the sense that bars on a prison regulate the<br/>
83<br/>

84<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
movement of a prisoner, or regulated in the sense that stairs regulate the<br/>access of the disabled. Code is a regulator in cyberspace because it defines the<br/>terms upon which cyberspace is offered. And those who set those terms<br/>increasingly recognize the code as a means to achieving the behaviors that<br/>benefit them best.<br/>
And so too with the Internet. Code on the Internet is also a regulator, and<br/>
people live life on the Internet subject to that regulation. But my strategy in<br/>this chapter is to begin with the more obscure as a way to build recognition<br/>about the familiar. Once you see the technique applied to worlds you are<br/>unlikely to inhabit, you will recognize the technique applied to the world you<br/>inhabit all the time.<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
Cyberspace is not one place. It is many places. And the character of these<br/>many places differ in ways that are fundamental. These differences come in<br/>part from differences in the people who populate these places, but demo-<br/>graphics alone don’t explain the variance. Something more is going on.<br/>
Here is a test. Read the following passage, and ask yourself whether the<br/>
description rings true for you:<br/>
I believe virtual communities promise to restore to Americans at the end of the<br/>
twentieth century what many of us feel was lost in the decades at the beginning of<br/>
the century—a stable sense of community, of place. Ask those who’ve been mem-<br/>
bers of such a virtual community, and they’ll tell you that what happens there is<br/>
more than an exchange of electronic impulses in the wires. It’s not just virtual<br/>
barn raising. . . . It’s also the comfort from others that a man like Phil Catalfo of the<br/>
WELL can experience when he’s up late at night caring for a child suffering from<br/>
leukemia, and he logs on to the WELL and pours out his anguish and fears. People<br/>
really do care for each other and fall in love over the Net, just as they do in geo-<br/>
graphic communities. And that “virtual” connectedness is a real sign of hope in a<br/>
nation that’s increasingly anxious about the fragmentation of public life and the<br/>
polarization of interest groups and the alienation of urban existence.1<br/>
There are two sorts of reactions to talk like this. To those who have been<br/>
in “cyberspace” for some time, such talk is extremely familiar. These people<br/>have been on different kinds of “nets” from the start. They moved to the Inter-<br/>net from more isolated communities—from a local BBS (bulletin board serv-<br/>ice), or, as Mike Godwin (the author of the passage) puts it, from a “tony”<br/>address like The WELL. For them the Net is a space for conversation, connec-<br/>tions, and exchange—a wildly promising location for making life in real space<br/>different.<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
85<br/>
But if you are a recent immigrant to this “space” (the old-timers call you<br/>
“newbies”), or if all you do on the Internet is check your stocks or look up<br/>movie times, you are likely to be impatient with talk like this. When people<br/>talk about “community,” about special ways to connect, or about the amazing<br/>power of this space to alter lives, you are likely to ask, “What is this idea of<br/>cyberspace as a place?” For newbies, those who have simply e-mailed or surfed<br/>the Web, the “community” of the Net is an odd sort of mysticism. How can<br/>anyone think of these pages full of advertisements and spinning icons as a<br/>community, or even as a space? To the sober newbie, this just sounds like<br/>hype high on java.2<br/>
Newbies are the silent majority of today’s Net.3 However much one<br/>
romanticizes the old days when the Net was a place for conversation and<br/>exchange, this is not its function for most of its users now. There are explod-<br/>ing communities of bloggers and creativity. But bloggers are still just 3 percent<br/>of Internet users; the vast majority of Internet use has no connection to any<br/>ideal of community.<br/>
Cyberspace has changed in its feel.4 How it looks, what you can do there,<br/>
how you are connected there—all this has changed. <i>Why </i>it has changed is a<br/>complicated question—a complete answer to which I can’t provide. Cyber-<br/>space has changed in part because the people—who they are, what their inter-<br/>ests are—have changed, and in part because the capabilities provided by the<br/>space have changed.<br/>
But part of the change has to do with the space itself. Communities,<br/>
exchange, and conversation all flourish in a certain type of space; they are<br/>extinguished in a different type of space.5 My hope is to illuminate the differ-<br/>ences between these two environments.<br/>
The next sections describe different cyber-places. The aim is to build<br/>
intuitions about how to think through the differences that we observe. These<br/>intuitions, in turn, will help us see something about where cyberspace is<br/>moving.<br/>
THE VALUES OF A SPACE<br/>
Spaces have values.6 They manifest these values through the practices or lives<br/>that they enable or disable. As Mark Stefik puts it:<br/>
[B]arriers within cyberspace—separate chat rooms, intranet gateways, digital<br/>
envelopes, and other systems to limit access—resemble the effects of national<br/>
borders, physical boundaries, and distance. Programming determines which<br/>
people can access which digital objects and which digital objects can interact<br/>

86<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
with other digital objects. How such programming regulates human interac-<br/>
tions—and thus modulates change—depends on the choices made.7<br/>
Choices mean that differently constituted spaces enable and disable differ-<br/>
ently. This is the first idea to make plain. Here is an example.<br/>
At the start of the Internet, communication was through text. Media such<br/>
as USENET newsgroups, Internet Relay Chat, and e-mail all confined<br/>exchange to text—to words on a screen, typed by a person (or so one<br/>thought).<br/>
The reason for this limitation is fairly obvious: The bandwidth of early Net<br/>
life was very thin. In an environment where most users connected at 1,200 baud,<br/>if they were lucky, graphics and streaming video would have taken an unbearably<br/>long time to download, if they downloaded at all. What was needed was an effi-<br/>cient mode of communication—and text is one of the most efficient.8<br/>
Most think of this fact about the early Net as a limitation. Technically, it<br/>
was. But this technical description does not exhaust its normative description<br/>as an architecture that made possible a certain kind of life. From this perspec-<br/>tive, limitations can be features; they can enable as well as disable. And this<br/>particular limitation enabled classes of people who were disabled in real-<br/>space life.<br/>
Think about three such classes—the blind, the deaf, and the “ugly.” In<br/>
real space these people face an extraordinary array of constraints on their<br/>ability to communicate. The blind person in real space is constantly con-<br/>fronted with architectures that presume he can see; he bears an extraordinary<br/>cost in retrofitting real-space architectures so that this presumption is not<br/>totally exclusionary. The deaf person in real space confronts architectures<br/>that presume she can hear; she too bears an extraordinary cost in retrofitting<br/>these architectures. The “ugly” person in real space (think of a bar or a social<br/>club) confronts architectures of social norms that make his appearance a bar-<br/>rier to a certain sort of intimacy. He endures extraordinary suffering in con-<br/>forming to these architectures.<br/>
In real space these three groups are confronted with architectures that dis-<br/>
able them relative to “the rest of us.” But in cyberspace, in its first iteration,<br/>they did not.<br/>
The blind could easily implement speech programs that read the (by def-<br/>
inition machine-readable) text and could respond by typing. Other people on<br/>the Net would have no way of knowing that the person typing the message<br/>was blind, unless he claimed to be. The blind were equal to the seeing.<br/>
The same with the deaf. There was no need to hear anything in this early<br/>
Internet. For the first time many of the deaf could have conversations, or<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
87<br/>
exchanges, in which the most salient feature was not that the person was deaf.<br/>The deaf were equal to the hearing.<br/>
And the same with the “ugly.” Because your appearance was not transmit-<br/>
ted with every exchange, the unattractive could have an intimate conversation<br/>with others that was not automatically defined by what they looked like. They<br/>could flirt or play or be sexual without their bodies (in an extremely under-<br/>appreciated sense) getting in the way. This first version of the Net made these<br/>people equal to “the beautiful.” In a virtual chat room, stunning eyes, a capti-<br/>vating smile, or impressive biceps don’t do it. Wit, engagement, and articulate-<br/>ness do.<br/>
The architecture of this original cyberspace gave these groups something<br/>
that they did not have in real space. More generally, it changed the mix of ben-<br/>efits and burdens that people faced—the literate were enabled and the attrac-<br/>tive disabled relative to real space. Architectures produced these enablings<br/>and disablings.<br/>
I’ve told this story as if it matters only to those who in real space are “dis-<br/>
abled.” But of course, “disabled” is a relative term.9 It is more accurate to say<br/>that the space changes the meaning of the enabled. A friend—a strikingly<br/>beautiful and powerful woman, married, and successful—described for me<br/>why she spends hours in political chat spaces, arguing with others about all<br/>sorts of political topics:<br/>
You don’t understand what it’s like to be me. You have lived your whole life in a<br/>
world where your words are taken for their meaning; where what you say is<br/>
heard for what it says. I’ve never had a space, before this space, where my words<br/>
were taken for what they meant. Always, before, they were words of “this babe,”<br/>
or “wife,” or “mother.” I could never speak as I. But here, I am as I speak.<br/>
Clearly, the space is enabling her, even though one would not have said<br/>
that in real space she was “disabled.”10<br/>
Over time, as bandwidth has expanded, this architecture has changed,<br/>
and so has the mix of benefits and burdens. When graphics entered the Net<br/>through the World Wide Web, the blind became “blind” again. As sound files<br/>or speech in virtual spaces have been created, the deaf have become “deaf ”<br/>again. And as chat rooms have started segregating into spaces where video-<br/>cams capture real images of the people chatting and spaces where there is<br/>just text, the video-unappealing are again unappealing.11 As the architectures<br/>change, definitions of who is “disabled” change as well.<br/>
My point is not to argue that the Net should not change—though of<br/>
course, if it can change in ways that minimize the disabling effect of sound<br/>

88<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
and graphics, then it no doubt should.12 However important, my point is not<br/>really about the “disabled” at all. I use this example simply to highlight a<br/>link—between these structures of code and the world this code enables. Codes<br/>constitute cyberspaces; spaces enable and disable individuals and groups. The<br/>selections about code are therefore in part a selection about who, what, and,<br/>most important, what ways of life will be enabled and disabled.<br/>
CYBER-PLACES<br/>
We can build on this point by looking at a number of “communities” that are<br/>constituted differently and that constitute different forms of life and by con-<br/>sidering what makes these differences possible.<br/>
America Online<br/>
America Online (AOL) is an online service provider—“by far the largest ISP<br/>in the world”13 with some 12 million subscribers in 1998 and 27 million<br/>today.14 But despite having the population of New York and New Jersey com-<br/>bined, AOL still describes itself as a “community.” A large community per-<br/>haps, but a community nonetheless.<br/>
This community has a constitution—not in the sense of a written docu-<br/>
ment (though there is that as well), but in the sense of a way of life for those<br/>who live there. Its founding vision was that community would make this<br/>place sing. So from its start, AOL’s emphasis has been on enabling people to<br/>interact, through chat, bulletin boards, and e-mail. (Today, AOL hosts the<br/>exchange of more messages daily than does the U.S. Post Office.15) Earlier<br/>providers, obsessed with providing content or advertising, limited or ignored<br/>the possibilities for interaction and exchange, but AOL saw interaction as the<br/>stuff that makes cyberspace different. It built itself on building a community<br/>and establishing itself as a place where people could say what they wanted.16<br/>
This interaction is governed by the rules of the place. Some of these rules<br/>
are formal, others customary. Among the formal are express terms to which<br/>every member subscribes upon joining AOL. These terms regulate a wide<br/>range of behaviors in this space, including the behavior of AOL members<br/>anywhere on the Internet.17<br/>
Increasingly, these rules have become controversial. AOL policies have<br/>
been called “Big Brother” practices. Arguments that get heated produce<br/>exchanges that are rude. But rudeness, or offensiveness, is not permitted in<br/>AOL’s community. When these exchanges are expunged, claims of “censor-<br/>ship” arise.18<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
89<br/>
My aim here, however, is not to criticize these rules of “netiquette.” AOL<br/>
also has other rules that regulate AOL members—rules expressed not in con-<br/>tracts but rather through the very architectures of the space. These rules are<br/>the most important part of AOL’s constitution, but they are probably the part<br/>considered last when we think about what regulates behavior in this cyber-<br/>place.<br/>
Consider some examples:<br/>For most of AOL’s life,19 as a member of AOL you could be any one of five<br/>
people. This was just one amazing feature of the space. When you started an<br/>account on AOL, you had the right to establish up to five identities, through<br/>five different “screen names” that in effect establish five different accounts.<br/>Some users, of course, used the five screen names to give other family mem-<br/>bers access to AOL. But not everyone used an AOL account like this. Think<br/>about the single woman, signing up for her first AOL account. AOL gave her<br/>up to five identities that she can define as she wishes—five different personae<br/>she can use in cyberspace.<br/>
What does that mean? A screen name is just a label for identifying who<br/>
you are when you are on the system. It need not (indeed, often cannot) be<br/>your own name. If your screen name is “StrayCat,” then people can reach you<br/>by sending e-mail to “straycat@aol.com.” If you are online, people can try to<br/>talk to you by paging StrayCat on the AOL system; a dialogue would then<br/>appear on your screen asking whether you want to talk to the person who<br/>paged you. If you enter a chat room, the list of residents there will add you as<br/>“StrayCat.”<br/>
But who is StrayCat? Here is a second dimension of control. StrayCat is<br/>
who StrayCat says she is. She can choose to define herself as no one at all. If<br/>she chooses to place a description of herself in the members’ directory, that<br/>description can be as complete or incomplete as she wishes. It can be true or<br/>false, explicit or vague, inviting or not. A member stumbling across StrayCat,<br/>then, in a chat room set up for stamp collectors could get her profile and read<br/>that StrayCat lives in Cleveland and is single and female. What happens next<br/>is anyone’s guess.<br/>
Yet this need only be one of StrayCat’s five identities. Let’s say there is a<br/>
different persona that StrayCat likes to have when she wanders through chat<br/>rooms. She can then select another screen name and define it in the directory<br/>as she wishes. Perhaps when StrayCat is having a serious discussion in a news-<br/>group or political list she prefers to speak as herself. She could then select a<br/>screen name close to her own name and define it according to who she really<br/>is. At other times StrayCat may like to pretend to be a man—engaging in vir-<br/>tual cross-dressing and all that might bring with it. One of her screen names<br/>

90<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
could then be a man’s. And so on. The point is the multiplicity that AOL<br/>allows, and the freedom this multiplicity permits.<br/>
No one except StrayCat needs to know which screen names are hers. She<br/>
is not required to publish the full list of her identities, and no one can find out<br/>who she is (unless she breaks the rules). (After revealing to the U.S. Navy the<br/>name of one of its members so that the Navy could prosecute the person for<br/>being a homosexual, AOL adopted a very strict privacy policy that promises<br/>never to allow a similar transgression to happen again.)20<br/>
So in AOL you were given a fantastic power of pseudonymity that the<br/>
“code writers” of real space simply do not give. You could, of course, try in real<br/>space to live the same range of multiple lives, and to the extent that these<br/>lives are not incompatible or inconsistent, you could quite often get away<br/>with it. For instance, you could be a Cubs fan during the summer and an<br/>opera buff during the winter. But unless you take extraordinary steps to hide<br/>your identity, in real space you are always tied back to you. You cannot simply<br/>define a different character; you must make it, and more important (and dif-<br/>ficult), you must sustain its separation from your original identity.<br/>
That is a first feature of the constitution of AOL—a feature constituted by<br/>
its code. A second is tied to speech—what you can say, and where.<br/>
Within the limits of decency, and so long as you are in the proper place,<br/>
you can say what you want on AOL. But beyond these limits, speech on AOL<br/>is constrained in a more interesting way: not by rules, but by the character of<br/>the potential audience. There are places in AOL where people can gather;<br/>there are places where people can go and read messages posted by others. But<br/>there is no space where everyone gathers at one time, or even a space that<br/>everyone must sooner or later pass through. There is no public space where<br/>you could address all members of AOL. There is no town hall or town meeting<br/>where people can complain in public and have their complaints heard by oth-<br/>ers. There is no space large enough for citizens to create a riot. The owners of<br/>AOL, however, can speak to all. Steve Case, the founder of AOL, used to write<br/>“chatty” letters to the members as the community’s “town mayor.”21 Case left<br/>AOL in 2005, and apparently no one has stepped into his speaker shoes. AOL<br/>does still advertise to all its members and can send everyone an e-mail, but<br/>only the owners and those they authorize can do so. The rest of the members<br/>of AOL can speak to crowds only where they notice a crowd—and never to a<br/>crowd greater than thirty-six (up from twenty-three when the first edition of<br/>this book was published).<br/>
This is another feature of the constitution of the space that AOL is, and it<br/>
too is defined by code. That only twenty-three people can be in a chat room<br/>at once is a choice of the code engineers. While their reasons could be many,<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
91<br/>
the effect is clear. One can’t imagine easily exciting members of AOL into<br/>public action, such as picketing the latest pricing policy. There are places to go<br/>to complain, but you have to take the trouble to go there yourself. There is no<br/>place where members can complain en masse.<br/>
Real space is different in this respect. Much of free speech law is devoted<br/>
to preserving spaces where dissent can occur—spaces that can be noticed,<br/>and must be confronted, by nondissenting citizens.22 In real space there are<br/>places where people can gather, places where they can leaflet. People have a<br/>right to the sidewalks, public streets, and other traditional public forums.<br/>They may go there and talk about issues of public import or otherwise say<br/>whatever they want. Constitutional law in real space protects the right of the<br/>passionate and the weird to get in the face of the rest. But no such design is<br/>built into AOL.23 As Dawn Nunziato writes,<br/>
AOL explains in its Community Guidelines that “like any city, we take pride<br/>
in—and are protective of—our community.” Unlike any other city, however,<br/>
AOL enjoys the unfettered discretion to censor constitutionally-protected speech<br/>
in its discussion forums and other online spaces, including “vulgar language”<br/>
(which, it warns, is “no more appropriate online than [it] would be at Thanks-<br/>
giving dinner”), “crude conversations about sex,” and “discussions about . . .<br/>
illegal drug abuse that imply it is acceptable.”24<br/>
This is not to romanticize the power of real-space public forums. (Nor is<br/>
it to pick on AOL: As Nunziato continues, “users seeking stronger protection<br/>for their expression might turn to an ISP other than AOL. They will find,<br/>however, similar restrictions on speech imposed by many other major<br/>ISPs.”25) We have become such an apolitical society that if you actually exer-<br/>cised this constitutionally protected right, people would think you were a nut.<br/>If you stood on a street corner and attacked the latest tax proposal in Con-<br/>gress, your friends would be likely to worry—and not about the tax proposal.<br/>There are exceptions—events can make salient the need for protest—but in<br/>the main, though real space has fewer controls through code on who can<br/>speak where, it has many more controls through norms on what people can<br/>say where. Perhaps in the end real space is much like AOL—the effective space<br/>for public speech is limited and often unimportant. That may well be. But my<br/>aim here is to identify the feature and to isolate what is responsible for it.<br/>And once again, it turns out to be a feature built into the code.<br/>
A third feature of AOL’s constitution also comes from its code. This is<br/>
traceability. While members are within the exclusive AOL content area (in<br/>other words, when they’re not using AOL as a gateway to the Internet), AOL<br/>

92<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
can (and no doubt does) trace your activities and collect information about<br/>them. What files you download, what areas you frequent, who your “buddies”<br/>are—all this is available to AOL. These data are extremely valuable; they help<br/>AOL structure its space to fit customer demand. But gaining the ability to col-<br/>lect these data required a design decision. This decision too was part of the<br/>constitution that is AOL—again, a part constituted by its code. It is a decision<br/>that gives some but not others the power to watch.<br/>
AOL is not exclusive in this enabling capacity. It shares the power. One<br/>
wonderful feature of the online space is something called “buddy lists.” Add<br/>someone to your buddy list, and when he comes online you hear the sound of<br/>a creaking door and are notified that he is online. (The “buddy” need not<br/>know he is being watched, though he can, if he knows, block the watching.) If<br/>that person goes into a chat area and you “locate” him, you will be told in<br/>what chat area he is. This power, given to ordinary users, can have complicated<br/>consequences. (Imagine sitting at work with your buddy feature turned on,<br/>watching your spouse come online, enter a chat area, and—you get the point.)<br/>This ability to monitor is built into the space. Individuals can turn it off, at<br/>least for a single watcher, but only if they know about it and think to change<br/>it.<br/>
Consider one final feature of the constitution of AOL, closely linked to the<br/>
last: commerce. In AOL you can buy things. You can buy things and download<br/>them, or buy things and have them sent to your home. When you buy, you<br/>buy with a screen name, and when you buy with a screen name, AOL knows<br/>(even if no one else does) just who you are. It knows who you are, it knows<br/>where you live in real space, and most important, it knows your credit card<br/>number and the security it provides.<br/>
AOL knows who you are—this is a feature of its design. All your behavior<br/>
on AOL is watched; all of it is monitored and tracked back to you as a user.<br/>AOL promises not to collect data about you individually, but it certainly col-<br/>lects data about you as part of a collective. And with this collective, and the<br/>link it provides back to you, AOL is a space that can better, and more effi-<br/>ciently, sell to you.<br/>
These four features mark AOL space as different from other places in<br/>
cyberspace. It is easier for AOL to identify who you are, and harder for indi-<br/>viduals to find out who you are; easier for AOL to speak to all its “citizens” as<br/>it wishes, and harder for dissidents to organize against AOL’s views about<br/>how things ought to be; easier for AOL to market, and harder for individuals<br/>to hide. AOL is a different normative world; it can create this different world<br/>because it is in control of the architecture of that world. Members in that<br/>space face, in a sense, a different set of laws of nature; AOL makes those laws.<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
93<br/>
Again, my aim is not to criticize the creation of this world or to say that<br/>
it is improper. No doubt AOL makes promises to its members that are<br/>designed to allay some of the concern that this control creates, and no doubt<br/>if the place became oppressive, the market would provide plenty of alterna-<br/>tives.<br/>
Rather my objective is to impart a sense of what makes AOL the way it is.<br/>
It is not just written rules; it is not just custom; it is not just the supply and<br/>demand of a knowing consuming public. What makes AOL is in large part the<br/>structure of the space. You enter AOL and you find it to be a certain universe.<br/>This space is constituted by its code. You can resist this code—you can resist<br/>how you find it, just as you can resist cold weather by putting on a sweater. But<br/>you are not going to change how it is. You do not have the power to change<br/>AOL’s code, and there is no place where you could rally AOL members to<br/>force AOL to change the code. You live life in AOL subject to its terms; if you<br/>do not like them, you go elsewhere.<br/>
These features of the AOL space have important implications for how it<br/>
is regulated. Imagine there is a problem on AOL that AOL wants to stop. It<br/>wants to prevent or at least control a certain behavior. What tools does AOL<br/>have?<br/>
First, it has all the tools that any club, fraternity, or “community” might<br/>
have. It can announce rules for its members (and AOL certainly does). Or it<br/>can try to stigmatize the behavior, to use the norms of the community to<br/>help regulate the problem. This AOL does as well. Alternatively, if the problem<br/>comes from the overuse of a particular resource, then the managers at AOL<br/>can price that resource differently by exacting a tax to reduce its usage or a dif-<br/>ferent price for those who use it too much.<br/>
But AOL has something more at hand. If AOL does not like a certain<br/>
behavior, then in at least some cases it can regulate that behavior by changing<br/>its architecture. If AOL is trying to control indecent language, it can write<br/>routines that monitor language usage; if there is improper mixing between<br/>adults and kids, AOL can track who is talking to whom; if there is a virus<br/>problem caused by people uploading infected files, it can run the files auto-<br/>matically through virus checkers; if there is stalking or harassing or threaten-<br/>ing behavior, AOL can block the connection between any two individuals.<br/>
In short, AOL can deal with certain types of problems by changing its<br/>
code. Because the universe that AOL members know (while in AOL) is<br/>defined by this code, AOL can use the code to regulate its members.<br/>
Think a bit about the power I am describing—and again, I am not com-<br/>
plaining or criticizing or questioning this power, only describing it. As you<br/>move through this space that AOL defines—entering a chat area, posting a<br/>

94<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
message to a bulletin board, entering a discussion space, sending instant-<br/>messages to another person, watching or following other people, uploading<br/>or downloading files from sites, turning to certain channels and reading cer-<br/>tain articles, or obsessively paging through a space looking for pictures of a<br/>certain actor or actress—as you do any of these things, AOL is, in an impor-<br/>tant sense, there. It is as if the system gives you a space suit that you use to<br/>navigate the space but that simultaneously monitors your every move.<br/>
In principle, the potential for control is extraordinary. Imagine AOL<br/>
slowing the response time for a certain kind of service it wants to discourage,<br/>or channeling the surfer through ads that it wants customers to see, or iden-<br/>tifying patterns of behavior that its monitors would watch, based on the fear<br/>that people with patterns like X are typically dangerous to people of type Y.<br/>I do not think AOL engages in activities like these, and I am not saying that<br/>there would be anything wrong if it did. But it is important to note that the<br/>potential for control in this “community” is unlimited—not in the sense that<br/>AOL could make life miserable (since people would then leave), but in the<br/>sense that it has a regulatory tool that others, in both real space and other<br/>cyberspaces, do not. Its power is, of course, checked by the market, but it<br/>has a tool of control that others in the market, but outside cyberspace, do not<br/>have.<br/>
In principle, then, AOL must choose. Every time AOL decides that it<br/>
wants to regulate a certain kind of behavior, it must select from among at least<br/>four modalities—rules, norms, prices, or architecture. And when selecting<br/>one of these four modalities, selecting architecture as a regulator will often<br/>make the most sense.<br/>
Counsel Connect<br/>
David Johnson began Counsel Connect (CC) in 1992 as an online lawyers’<br/>cooperative. The idea was simple: Give subscribers access to each other; let<br/>them engage in conversations with each other; and through this access and<br/>these conversations, value would be created. Lawyers would give and take<br/>work; they would contribute ideas as they found ideas in the space. A different<br/>kind of law practice would emerge—less insular, less exclusive, more broadly<br/>based.<br/>
I thought the idea amazing, though many thought it nuts. For a time the<br/>
system was carried by Lexis; in 1996 it was sold to American Lawyer Media,<br/>L.P.; in 1997 it migrated to the Internet, and it closed in 1999.26 At its peak, it<br/>boasted thousands of subscribers, though it is hard to know how many of<br/>them contributed to the discussion online. Most simply watched the discus-<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
95<br/>
sions of others, perhaps linking three or four discussion groups of their par-<br/>ticular interest, plus a few of more general interest. But many saw the emerg-<br/>ing culture as something amazing and new (for lawyers at least). As its<br/>founder, David Johnson, described it, “Think of The Well for lawyers, with its<br/>own highly unique evolution, emergence, maintenance, and adaptation.”27<br/>Members got to know each other well. “Inevitably, this led to numerous real<br/>world meetings. . . . Of those I attended, it always resemble[d] a get together<br/>of long-time acquaintances even though many of us ha[d] not previously<br/>met face to face.”28<br/>
The discussion was organized into legal topics. Each topic was divided<br/>
into discussion groups, with each group led by a discussion leader. The leader<br/>was not a moderator; he or she had no power to cancel a post. The leader was<br/>there to inspire conversation—to induce others to speak by being encouraging<br/>or provocative.<br/>
At its height, there were some 90 groups in this space. The poster of a par-<br/>
ticular message may have had it removed, but if the poster did not remove it,<br/>it stayed—at first in the list of topics being discussed, and later in an archive<br/>that could be searched by any member.<br/>
Members paid a fee to join and get an account with their real name on it.<br/>
Postings use members’ real names, and anyone wondering who someone is<br/>could simply link to a directory. Members of CC must be members of the bar,<br/>unless they are journalists. Others have no right to access; the community<br/>here is exclusive.<br/>
Postings in the space look very much like postings in a USENET news-<br/>
group. A thread could be started by anyone, and replies to a thread were<br/>appended to the end. Because messages did not move off the system, one<br/>could easily read from the start of a thread to its end. The whole conversation,<br/>not just a snippet, was preserved.<br/>
These features of CC space were obviously designed; the architects chose<br/>
to enable certain features and to disable others. We can list here some of the<br/>effects of these choices.<br/>
First, there was the effect from being required to use your own name.<br/>
You were more likely to think before speaking and to be careful about being<br/>right before saying something definitive. You were constrained by the com-<br/>munity, which would judge what you said, and in this community you could<br/>not escape from being linked to what you said. Responsibility was a conse-<br/>quence of this architecture, but so was a certain inhibition. Does a senior<br/>partner at a leading law firm really want to ask a question that will announce<br/>his ignorance about a certain area of law? Names cannot be changed to pro-<br/>tect the ignorant, so they will often simply not speak.<br/>

96<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Second, there was an effect from forcing all discussion into threads. Post-<br/>
ings were kept together; a question was asked, and the discussion began from<br/>the question. If you wanted to contribute to this discussion, you had to first<br/>read through the other postings before responding. Of course, this was not a<br/>technical requirement—you certainly had a choice not to read. But if you did<br/>not read through the entire thread, you could well end up repeating what<br/>another had said and so reveal that you were speaking without listening.<br/>Again, the use of real names ties members’ behavior to the norms of the com-<br/>munity.<br/>
Third, there was the effect of reputation: The reputation you built in this<br/>
space was based on the kind of advice you gave. Your reputation survived any<br/>particular post and was, of course, affected by any subsequent posts. These<br/>posts were archived and searchable. If you said one thing about topic X and<br/>then the opposite later on, you were at least open to a question about consis-<br/>tency.<br/>
Fourth, there was the effect of tying reputation to a real name in a real<br/>
community of professionals. Misbehaving here mattered elsewhere. CC thus<br/>got the benefit of that community—it got the benefit, that is, of the norms of<br/>a particular community. These norms might have supported relatively pro-<br/>ductive community behavior—more productive, that is, than the behavior of<br/>a group whose members are fundamentally mixed. They might also have sup-<br/>ported punishing those who deviated from appropriate behavior. Thus, CC<br/>got the benefit of community sanction to control improper behavior, whereas<br/>AOL had to rely on its own content police to ensure that people stayed prop-<br/>erly on topic.<br/>
We can describe the world of CC that these features constitute in two<br/>
different ways, just as we can describe the world AOL constitutes in two dif-<br/>ferent ways. One is the life that CC’s features made possible—highly dialogic<br/>and engaged, but monitored and with consequences. The other is the regula-<br/>bility by the manager of the life that goes on in the CC space. And here we can<br/>see a significant difference between this space and AOL.<br/>
CC could have used the norms of a community to regulate more effec-<br/>
tively than AOL can. CC benefited from the norms of the legal community;<br/>it knew that any misbehavior would be sanctioned by that community.<br/>There was, of course, less “behavior” in this space than in AOL (you did<br/>fewer things here), but such as it was, CC behavior was quite significantly<br/>regulated by the reputations of members and the consequences of using<br/>their real names.<br/>
These differences together had an effect on CC’s ability to regulate its<br/>
members. They enabled a regulation through modalities other than code.<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
97<br/>
They made behavior in CC more regulable by norms than behavior in AOL is.<br/>CC in turn may have had less control than AOL does (since the controlling<br/>norms are those of the legal community), but it also bore less of the burden<br/>of regulating its members’ behavior. Limiting the population, making mem-<br/>bers’ behavior public, tying them to their real names—these are the tools of<br/>self-regulation in this virtual space.<br/>
But CC was like AOL in one important way: It was not a democracy and<br/>
neither is AOL. Management in both cases controls what will happen in the<br/>space—again, not without constraint, because the market is an important con-<br/>straint. But in neither place do “the people” have the power to control what goes<br/>on. Perhaps they did, indirectly, in CC more than AOL, since it is the norms of<br/>“the people” that regulate behavior in CC. But these norms cannot be used<br/>against CC directly. The decisions of CC and AOL managers may have been<br/>affected by market forces—individuals can exit, competitors can steal customers<br/>away. But voting doesn’t direct where AOL goes, and it didn’t with CC either.<br/>
That’s not the case with the next cyber-place. At least, not anymore.<br/>
LambdaMOO<br/>
LambdaMOO is a text-based virtual reality. People from across the world<br/>(today close to six thousand of them) link to this space and interact in ways<br/>that the space permits. The reality is the product of this interaction. Individ-<br/>uals can participate in the construction of this reality—sometimes for<br/>upwards of eighty hours a week. For some this interaction is the most sus-<br/>tained human contact of their entire lives. For most it is a kind of interaction<br/>unmatched by anything else they know.<br/>
In the main, people just talk here. But it is not the talk of an AOL chat<br/>
room. The talk in a MUD is in the service of construction—of constructing<br/>a character and a community. You interact in part by talking, and this talking<br/>is tied to a name. This name, and the memories of what it has done, live in the<br/>space, and over time people in the space come to know the person by what<br/>these memories recall.<br/>
The life within these MUDs differ. Elizabeth Reid describes two different<br/>
“styles”29—social-style MUD and an adventure or game-style MUD. Social<br/>MUDs are simply online communities where people talk and build characters<br/>or elements for the MUD. Adventure MUDs are games, with (virtual) prizes<br/>or power to be won through the deployment of skill in capturing resources or<br/>defeating an enemy. In either context, the communities survive a particular<br/>interaction. They become virtual clubs, though with different purposes. Mem-<br/>bers build reputations through their behavior in these clubs.<br/>

CODE 2.0<br/>
You get a character simply by joining the MOO (though in Lamb-<br/>
daMOO the waiting list for a character extends over many months). When<br/>you join the space, you define the character you will have. At least, you<br/>define certain features of your character. You select a name and a gender (no<br/>gender is an option as well) and describe your character. Some descriptions<br/>are quite ordinary (Johnny Manhattan is “tall and thin, pale as string cheese,<br/>wearing a neighborhood hat”).30 Others, however, are quite extraordinary.<br/>(Legba, for instance, is a Haitian trickster spirit of indeterminate gender,<br/>brown-skinned and wearing an expensive pearl gray suit, top hat, and dark<br/>glasses.)31<br/>
Julian Dibbell broke the story of this space to the nonvirtual world in an<br/>
article in the <i>Village Voice</i>.32 The story that was the focus of Dibbell’s article<br/>involved a character called Mr. Bungle who, it turns out, was actually a group<br/>of NYU undergraduates sharing this single identity. Bungle entered a room<br/>late one evening and found a group of characters well known in that space.<br/>The full story cannot be told any better than Dibbell tells it. For our purposes,<br/>the facts will be enough.33<br/>
Bungle had a special sort of power. By earning special standing in the<br/>
LambdaMOO community, he had “voodoo” power: he could take over the<br/>voices and actions of other characters and make them appear to do things<br/>they did not really do. This Bungle did that night to a group of women and at<br/>least one person of ambiguous gender. He invoked this power, in this public<br/>space, and took over the voices of these people. Once they were in his control,<br/>Bungle “raped” these women, violently and sadistically, and made it seem as<br/>if they enjoyed the rape.<br/>
The “rape” was virtual in the sense that the event happened only on the<br/>
wires. “No bodies touched,” as Dibbell describes it.<br/>
Whatever physical interaction occurred consisted of a mingling of electronic<br/>
signals sent from sites spread out between New York City and Sydney, Australia.<br/>
. . . He commenced his assault entirely unprovoked at, or about 10 P.M. Pacific<br/>
Standard Time. . . . [H]e began by using his voodoo doll to force one of the<br/>
room’s occupants to sexually service him in a variety of more or less conven-<br/>
tional ways. That this victim was exu. . . . He turned his attentions now to Moon-<br/>
dreamer . . . forcing her into unwanted liaisons with other individuals present in<br/>
the room. . . . His actions grew progressively violent. . . . He caused Moon-<br/>
dreamer to violate herself with a piece of kitchen cutlery. He could not be<br/>
stopped until at last someone summoned Iggy . . . who brought with him a gun<br/>
of near wizardly powers, a gun that didn’t kill but enveloped its targets in a cage<br/>
impermeable even to a voodoo doll’s powers.34<br/>

Rape is a difficult word to use in any context, but particularly here. Some<br/>
will object that whatever happened in this virtual space, it has nothing to do<br/>with rape. Yet even if “it” was not “rape,” all will see a link between rape and<br/>what happened to these women there. Bungle used his power over these<br/>women for his own (and against their) sexual desire; he sexualized his vio-<br/>lence and denied them even the dignity of registering their protest.<br/>
For our purposes, whether what happened here was really rape is beside<br/>
the point. What matters is how the community reacted. The community was<br/>outraged by what Bungle had done, and many thought something should be<br/>done in response.<br/>
They gathered, this community of members of LambdaMOO, in a virtual<br/>
room at a set time, to discuss what to do. Some thirty showed up, the largest<br/>meeting the community had known. Some thought that Bungle should be<br/>expelled—“toaded,” as it is described, killed for purposes of the MOO. Others<br/>thought that nothing should be done; Bungle was certainly a creep, but the<br/>best thing to do to creeps was simply to ignore them. Some called on the<br/>Wizards of the space—the creators, the gods—to intervene to deal with this<br/>character. The Wizards declined: Their job, they replied, was to create the<br/>world; the members had to learn to live within it.<br/>
There was really no law that governed what Bungle had done. No real-<br/>
space law reached sexual pranks like this, and neither did any explicit rule of<br/>LambdaMOO.35 This troubled many who wanted to do something. Invoking<br/>real-space ideals about fair notice and due process, these people argued that<br/>Bungle could not be punished for violating rules that did not exist at the time.<br/>
Two extremes eventually emerged. One side urged vigilantism: Bungle<br/>
was a miscreant, and something should be done about him. But what<br/>shouldn’t be done, they argued, was for LambdaMOO to respond by creating<br/>a world of regulation. LambdaMOO did not need a state; it needed a few<br/>good vigilantes. It needed people who would enforce the will of the commu-<br/>nity without the permanent intrusion of some central force called the state.<br/>Bungle should be expelled, killed, or “toaded”—and someone would do it. But<br/>only if the group resisted the call to organize itself into a state.<br/>
The other side promoted just one idea: democracy. With the cooperation<br/>
of the Wizards, LambdaMOO should establish a way to vote on rules that<br/>would govern how people in the space behaved. Any question could be made<br/>the subject of a ballot; there was no constitution limiting the scope of what<br/>democracy could decide. An issue decided by the ballot would be imple-<br/>mented by the Wizards. From then on, it would be a rule.<br/>
Both extremes had their virtues, and both invited certain vices. The anar-<br/>
chy of the first risked chaos. It was easy to imagine the community turning<br/>

100<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
against people with little or no warning; one imagined vigilantes roaming<br/>the space, unconstrained by any rules, “toading” people whose crimes hap-<br/>pened to strike them as “awful.” For those who took this place less seriously<br/>than real space, this compromise was tolerable. But what was tolerable for<br/>some was intolerable to others—as Bungle had learned.<br/>
Democracy seemed natural, yet many resisted it as well. The idea that<br/>
politics could exist in LambdaMOO seemed to sully the space. The thought<br/>that ideas would have to be debated and then voted on was just another bur-<br/>den. Sure, rules would be known and behavior could be regulated, but it all<br/>began to seem like work. The work took something from the fun the space<br/>was to have been.<br/>
In the end, both happened. The debate that evening wound down after<br/>
almost three hours. No clear resolution had found its way in. But a resolution<br/>of sorts did occur. As Dibbell describes it:<br/>
It was also at this point, most likely, that TomTraceback reached his decision. Tom-<br/>
Traceback was a wizard, a taciturn sort of fellow who’d sat brooding on the sidelines<br/>
all evening. He hadn’t said a lot, but what he had said indicated that he took the<br/>
crime committed against exu and Moondreamer very seriously, and that he felt no<br/>
particular compassion toward the character who had committed it. But on the other<br/>
hand he had made it equally plain that he took the elimination of a fellow player just<br/>
as seriously, and moreover that he had no desire to return to the days of wizardly<br/>
intervention. It must have been difficult, therefore, to reconcile the conflicting<br/>
impulses churning within him at that moment. In fact, it was probably impossible,<br/>
for . . . as much as he would have liked to make himself an instrument of the MOO’s<br/>
collective will, [he surely realized that under the present order of things] he must in<br/>
the final analysis either act alone or not act at all.<br/>
So TomTraceback acted alone.<br/>
He told the lingering few players in the room that he had to go, and then he<br/>
went. It was a minute or two before 10 P.M. He did it quietly and he did it privately,<br/>
but all anyone had to do to know he’d done it was to type the @who command,<br/>
which was normally what you typed if you wanted to know a player’s present loca-<br/>
tion and the time he last logged in. But if you had run an @who on Mr. Bungle not<br/>
too long after TomTraceback left emmeline’s room, the database would have told you<br/>
something different.<br/>
“Mr_Bungle,” it would have said, “is not the name of any player.”<br/>
The date, as it happened, was April Fool’s Day, but this was no joke: Mr. Bungle<br/>
was truly dead and truly gone.36<br/>

When the Wizards saw this, they moved to the other extreme. With no<br/>
formal decision by the citizens, the Wizards called forth a democracy. Starting<br/>May 1, 1993,37 any matter could be decided by ballot, and any proposition<br/>receiving at least twice as many votes for as against would become the law.38<br/>Many wondered whether this was an advance or not.<br/>
There is a lot to think about in this story, even in my savagely abridged<br/>
version.39 But I want to focus on the sense of loss that accompanied the Wiz-<br/>ards’ decision. There is a certain romance tied to the idea of establishing a<br/>democracy—Kodak commercials with tearful Berliners as the Wall comes<br/>down and all that. The romance is the idea of self-government and of estab-<br/>lishing structures that facilitate it. But LambdaMOO’s move to self-govern-<br/>ment, through structures of democracy, was not just an achievement. It was<br/>also a failure. The space had failed. It had failed, we could say, to self-regulate.<br/>It had failed to engender values in its population sufficient to avoid just the<br/>sort of evil Bungle had perpetrated. The debate marked the passage of the<br/>space from one kind of place to another. From a space self-regulated to a<br/>space regulated by self.<br/>
It might seem odd that there would be a place where the emergence of<br/>
democracy would so depress people. But this kind of reaction is not uncom-<br/>mon in cyber-places. Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon tell a story of the emer-<br/>gence of a “widget” called the FINGER command on UNIX, that would allow<br/>users to see when the last time another user had been on the computer, and<br/>whether she had read her mail. Some thought (not surprisingly, I should<br/>think) that this command was something of an invasion of privacy. Whose<br/>business was it when I was last at my machine, and why should they get to<br/>know whether I have read my mail?<br/>
A programmer at Carnegie Mellon University, Ivor Durham, changed the<br/>
command to give the user the power to avoid this spying finger. The result?<br/>“Durham was flamed without mercy. He was called everything from spineless<br/>to socially irresponsible to a petty politician, and worse—but not for pro-<br/>tecting privacy. He was criticized for monkeying with the openness of the<br/>network.”40<br/>
The values of the UNIX world were different. They were values embedded<br/>
in the code of UNIX. To change the code was to change the values, and mem-<br/>bers of the community fought that change.<br/>
So too with the changes to LambdaMOO. Before the balloting, Lamb-<br/>
daMOO was regulated through norms. These regulations of social structures<br/>were sustained by the constant policing of individual citizens. They were the<br/>regulations of a community; the rise of democracy marked the fall of this<br/>community. Although norms would no doubt survive the establishment of a<br/>

102<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
democracy, their status was forever changed. Before the democracy, a struggle<br/>over which norms should prevail could be resolved only by consensus—by<br/>certain views prevailing in a decentralized way. Now such a struggle could be<br/>resolved by the power of a majority—not through what a majority did, but<br/>through how they voted.<br/>
I’ve romanticized this bizarre little world far more than I intended. I do<br/>
not mean to suggest that the world of LambdaMOO before democracy was<br/>necessarily better than the one after. I want only to mark a particular change.<br/>Like CC, and unlike AOL, LambdaMOO is a place where norms regulate. But<br/>unlike CC, LambdaMOO is now a place where members have control over<br/>restructuring the norms.<br/>
Such control changes things. Norms become different when ballots can<br/>
overrule them, and code becomes different when ballots can order Wizards to<br/>change the world. These changes mark a movement from one kind of norma-<br/>tive space to another, from one kind of regulation to another.<br/>
In all three of these cyber-places, code is a regulator. But there are important<br/>
differences among the three. Norms have a relevance in CC and LambdaMOO<br/>that they do not in AOL; democracy has a relevance in LambdaMOO that it<br/>does not have in CC or AOL. And monitoring has a relevance in AOL that it<br/>does not have in LambdaMOO or CC (since neither of the latter two use data<br/>about individuals for commercial purposes, either internal or external to the<br/>organization). Code constitutes these three communities; as Jennifer Mnookin<br/>says of LambdaMOO,“politics [is] implemented through technology.”41 Differ-<br/>ences in the code constitute them differently, but some code makes community<br/>thicker than others. Where community is thick, norms can regulate.<br/>
The next space in this survey is also constituted by code, though in this<br/>
case the “management” has less ability to change its basic architecture. This<br/>code is net code—a protocol of the Internet that is not easily changed by a sin-<br/>gle user. At least it was not easy for me.<br/>

His name was IBEX, and no one knew who he was. I probably could have fig-<br/>ured it out—I had the data to track him down—but after he did what he did,<br/>I did not want to know who he was. He was probably a student in the very first<br/>class about cyberspace that I taught, and I would have failed him, because I<br/>was furious about what he had done. The class was “The Law of Cyberspace”;<br/>version one of that class was at Yale.<br/>
I say version one because I had the extraordinary opportunity to teach that<br/>
class at three extraordinary law schools—first at Yale, then at the University of<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
103<br/>
Chicago, and finally at Harvard. These were three very different places, with<br/>three very different student bodies, but one part of the course was the same in<br/>each place. Every year a “newsgroup” was associated with the class—an elec-<br/>tronic bulletin board where students could post messages about questions<br/>raised in the course, or about anything at all. These postings began conversa-<br/>tions—threads of discussion, one message posted after another, debating or<br/>questioning what the earlier message had said.<br/>
These newsgroups constituted what philosophers might call “dialogic<br/>
communities.” They were spaces where discussion could occur, but where<br/>what was said was preserved for others to read, as in CC. That was the dialogic<br/>part. The community was what was made over time as people got to know<br/>each other—both in this space and in real space. One year students in the class<br/>and students outside the class (who had been watching the .law.cyber discus-<br/>sions develop) had a party; another year the students outside the class were<br/>invited to attend one class. But over the three years, at three different schools,<br/>it was clear that three communities had been made. Each was born on a par-<br/>ticular date, and each lived for at least a couple of months.<br/>
My story here comes from Yale. Yale is an odd sort of law school, though<br/>
odd in a good way. It is small and filled with extremely bright people, many of<br/>whom do not really want to be lawyers. It fashions itself as a community, and<br/>everyone from the dean on down (not a “Yale” way to describe things) strives<br/>continuously to foster and sustain this sense of community among the stu-<br/>dents. To a large extent, it works—not in the sense that there is perpetual<br/>peace, but in the sense that people everywhere are aware of this sense of com-<br/>munity. Some embrace it, others resist it, but resistance, like an embrace, says<br/>that something is there. One does not resist the community of people on a<br/>Greyhound bus.<br/>
One extraordinary feature of the Yale Law School is “the Wall.” The Wall<br/>
is a place where people can post comments about whatever they want to say.<br/>A letter can be posted about gay rights at Yale, or a protest about Yale’s treat-<br/>ment of unionized workers. Political messages are posted as well as points<br/>about law. Each posting makes additional ones possible—either scribbled on<br/>the original post or appended underneath the post.<br/>
An extraordinary sign for any visitor, the Wall is located right at the center<br/>
of the law school. In the middle of a fake Gothic structure is a stone space with<br/>scores of papers posted in random fashion. Around the posts stand wandering<br/>students, reading what others have said. This is Yale’s speakers’ corner, though<br/>the speakers are writers, and the writing is substantive. There is little to be<br/>gained on the Wall through rhetoric; to gain respect there, you must say some-<br/>thing of substance.<br/>

104<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
One rule, however, governs this space. All postings must be signed; any<br/>
posting without a signature is removed. Originally, no doubt, the rule meant<br/>that the posting must be signed by the person who wrote it. But because this<br/>is Yale, where no rule can exist without a thousand questions raised, a custom<br/>has emerged whereby an anonymous post can be signed by someone not its<br/>author (“Signed but not written by X”). That signature gives the post the<br/>pedigree it needs to survive on the Wall.<br/>
The reasons for this rule are clear, but so too are its problems. Let’s say you<br/>
want to criticize the dean for a decision he has made. The dean, however<br/>sweet, is a powerful person, and you might well prefer to post a message with-<br/>out your name attached to it. Or say you are a student with political views that<br/>make you an outsider. Posting a message with those views and your signature<br/>might draw the scorn of your classmates. Free speech is not speech without<br/>consequence, and scorn, or shame, or ostracism are likely consequences of lots<br/>of speech.<br/>
Anonymity, then, is a way around this dilemma. With anonymity, you<br/>
can say what you want without fear. In some cases, for some people, the right<br/>to speak anonymously makes sense.<br/>
Still, a community might want to resist this right. Just as anonymity might<br/>
give you the strength to state an unpopular view, it can also shield you if you<br/>post an irresponsible, or slanderous, or hurtful view. You might want to ques-<br/>tion the policies of the dean, or you might want falsely to accuse a fellow stu-<br/>dent of cheating. Both utterances benefit from anonymity, but the community<br/>has good reason to resist utterances like the second.<br/>
As far as I know, IBEX never said anything on the Wall. Instead, he spoke<br/>
in the newsgroup associated with my class. By design, the newsgroup was<br/>open to anyone at Yale who wanted to speak. Unlike the Wall, however, the<br/>technology allowed users to call themselves whatever they wanted. “IBEX,” of<br/>course, was a pseudonym. For purposes of the Wall, a pseudonym was just like<br/>anonymous speech—you did not have to use your real name. But in a news-<br/>group a pseudonymous posting is quite different from an anonymous post-<br/>ing. Over time you can come to know the character of a pseudonym. In the<br/>class that year, along with IBEX, we had SpeedRacer, MadMacs, CliffClaven,<br/>Aliens, blah, and Christopher Robbin. While members of the class might<br/>know who these participants were (we all knew who MadMacs was, but only<br/>a few of us knew SpeedRacer), each pseudonym had a character.<br/>
The character of IBEX was bad; this much was clear from the start. Before<br/>
IBEX appeared, life in the space flourished. At first people were timid, but<br/>polite. Brave souls would post an idea or a joke, and conversation would con-<br/>tinue around the idea or joke for a bit. After a couple of weeks the conversa-<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
105<br/>
tion would become quite intense. Patterns of exchange began. People had<br/>questions; others had answers. People stumbled as they spoke, but they were<br/>beginning, slowly, to speak.<br/>
Some things about how they spoke were immediately noticeable. First,<br/>
women spoke more in this space than they did in class. Maybe not more in a<br/>statistically significant sense, but more.42 Second, helpers quickly developed<br/>and differentiated from those who received their help. Soon a class developed<br/>online—a real class that identified itself as such and spoke as a class in a way<br/>that a teacher dreams of in real space, and in a way I had never known.<br/>
Why this happened I could not really say. Una Smith may have been a cat-<br/>
alyst. I said that I taught this course three times. Each time (without my inter-<br/>vention at all) there was an Una Smith participating in the newsgroup. At Yale<br/>she was a real person, but after Yale I thought of her as a type. She was always<br/>a woman from outside the class; she was always extremely knowledgeable<br/>about the Net and about USENET; and she always wandered into my (virtual)<br/>class and began telling the others how they should behave. When someone<br/>violated a norm of the Net, Una would correct them. Often this instruction was<br/>not taken terribly well (these were, after all, law students). Soon the class would<br/>rally to defend the instructed and to challenge her to defend her rules. And of<br/>course, expert that she was, she usually had an answer that did defend the<br/>rules she had dictated. This exchange soon became a focus of the class. Una had<br/>drawn their anger, and the class gained cohesiveness as a result.<br/>
About a month and a half into the course, the group reached an apex of<br/>
sorts. It became the best it would be. I remember the moment well. Early on<br/>a spring afternoon I noticed that someone had posted the first line of a poem.<br/>By the end of the day, without any coordination, the class had finished the<br/>poem. There had been rhythm to the exchanges; now there was rhyme. Things<br/>hummed in the newsgroup, and people were genuinely surprised about this<br/>space.<br/>
It was then that IBEX appeared. I think it was just after we had discussed<br/>
anonymity in class, so maybe his later claims to have been serving a pedagog-<br/>ical role were true. But he appeared after one of our classes—appeared, it<br/>seemed, just to issue an attack on another member of the class. Not an attack<br/>on his ideas, but on him. So vicious and so extensive was this attack that when<br/>I read it, I didn’t know quite how to understand it. Could it have been real?<br/>
Almost immediately, conversation in the group died. It just stopped. No<br/>
one said anything, as if everyone were afraid that the monster that had entered<br/>our space would turn his fury on one of them next. Until, that is, the victim<br/>responded, with an answer that evinced the wounds of the attack. IBEX’s<br/>words had cut. The victim was angry and hurt, and he attacked back.<br/>

106<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
But his salvo only inspired another round of viciousness, even more vile<br/>
than the first. With this, other members of the class could not resist joining in.<br/>IBEX was attacked by a string of characters in the class as cowardly for hiding<br/>behind a pseudonym and as sick for what he had said. None of this had any<br/>effect. IBEX came back, again and again, with an ugliness that was as extreme<br/>as it was unrelenting.<br/>
The space had been changed. Conversation fell off, people drifted away.<br/>
Some no doubt left because they were disgusted with what had happened;<br/>others did not want to be IBEX’s next target. There was a brief period of life<br/>in the space as people rallied to attack IBEX. But as he came back again and<br/>again, each time more vicious than the last, most simply left. (One time IBEX<br/>came back to protest that he had been wronged; in the week before, he<br/>claimed, he had not posted anything, but someone wearing the white sheet of<br/>IBEX had posted in IBEX’s name, so that he, the real IBEX, had been defamed.<br/>The class had little sympathy.)<br/>
But it was not just the online class that changed. As we met face to face<br/>
each week, I felt the atmosphere bend. People felt the creature in the room,<br/>though no one could believe he was a student at the Yale Law School. This was<br/>their classmate, hiding behind a smile or a joke in real space, but vicious in<br/>cyberspace. And the very idea that this evil was hidden under a smile changed<br/>how people felt about smiles.<br/>
Some called this the “David Lynch effect,” an allusion to the director who<br/>
portrays the rot of society just under freshly painted façades. We felt in that<br/>class the rot of our community just under the surface of smiling and func-<br/>tional students. There was a (relatively tame) Jake Baker in our midst. The<br/>space had permitted behavior that destroyed community—community that<br/>the space itself had created. Community had been created in part through the<br/>ability to hide—to hide behind a benign pseudonym; to hide hesitation, or<br/>editing, in the writing; to hide your reaction; to hide that you were not paying<br/>attention. These anonymities had made the community what it was. But the<br/>same anonymity that created the community gave birth to IBEX as well, and<br/>thus took the community away.<br/>

These four places that I have just described were all described in the first edi-<br/>tion of this book, each in just about the same terms. They’re old stories, and<br/>the lessons they teach are still precisely the lesson this chapter is meant to<br/>convey. But I don’t mean to suggest that there’s been no interesting progress<br/>in the cyberspaces that the Internet has inspired. The last five years have wit-<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>

nessed an explosion in cyberspaces, much more dramatic than anything I<br/>imagined when I first wrote this book.<br/>
In one sense, these spaces are nothing really new. They have fancy new<br/>
technology that, because computers are faster and bandwidth is broader, func-<br/>tions much better than their earlier versions. But the MMOG space I<br/>described in Chapter 2 was inspired by real places.<br/>
What’s changed, however, is size. As Julian Dibbell described it to me, the<br/>
question is<br/>
does size matter in these kinds of spaces? And I think it does. The text-based<br/>
world is naturally limited in size. The limit is not so much text versus graphics<br/>
as it is limited cultural accessibility versus a much broader accessibility. That<br/>
makes for larger spaces.43<br/>
The result is “something socially richer in a lot of ways,”“not so much the<br/>
particular affordances of 3D graphic imagery, which will also someday look<br/>pretty crude.”<br/>
Massively Multiple Online Role Playing Games (again, MMOGs, or<br/>
MMORPGs) have become a whole industry. Literally millions spend hun-<br/>dreds, sometimes thousands of hours each year in these spaces along with lit-<br/>erally billions of dollars to live these second lives. While living these second<br/>lives, of course, they are also living a life in real space. When they’re playing<br/>the MMOG World of Warcraft, they are at the same time playing father or<br/>wife in real space. They have thus not left the real world to go to these other<br/>places. But they integrate the other places into their real world life, and the last<br/>five years has seen an explosion in the percentage of real-world life that is<br/>lived virtually.<br/>
These “games” can be divided roughly into two types. In one type, people<br/>
“play” a game that has been defined by others. These are “role-playing games.”<br/>Thus, World of Warcraft is a role-playing game in which people compete to<br/>gain wealth and status (making it not so different from real life). Grand Theft<br/>Auto is a game in which people engage in a kind of virtual crime. These games<br/>all have a structure to them, but they differ in the degree to which people can<br/>customize or create their own characters or environments. The vast majority<br/>of online games are role-playing games in this sense. One site that tracks these<br/>communities estimates 97 percent are role-playing games of some sort.44<br/>
The second type involves much more construction. These spaces provide<br/>
communities in which people at a minimum socialize. In addition to social-<br/>izing, there is creative and commercial activity. Depending upon the game,<br/>the mix among these activities differs substantially. But they all aim to create<br/>

CODE 2.0<br/>
a virtual world that inspires a real community within itself. These games are<br/>an extension of the MOOs I described above. But they extend the virtual<br/>community of a MOO beyond those who feel comfortable manipulating<br/>text. These worlds are graphically real, even if they are virtual.<br/>
Of course, within both of these types of MMOGs, there is creativity. The<br/>
differences between them are simply a matter of degree. And within both,<br/>there is commerce. Second Life—described more below—generates over<br/>“$4,000,000 U.S. in interpersonal transactions”45 a month. Aggregated across<br/>games, as Edward Castronova describes, there is a great deal of commerce<br/>produced by these virtual worlds.<br/>
“The commerce flow generated by people buying and selling money and<br/>
other virtual items (that is, magic wands, spaceships, armor) amounts to at<br/>least $30 million annually in the United States, and $100 million globally.”46<br/>
And more interesting (and bizarre) is Castronova’s estimate of the gross<br/>
national product per capita produced in various virtual worlds. EverQuest, for<br/>example, has a GDP which is about half that of “the Caribbean Island Nation<br/>of Dominica.”47 And the GDP per capita of Norrath “was about the same as<br/>Bulgaria’s and four times higher than China’s or India’s.”48<br/>
For my purposes here, however, I want to focus on the second type of<br/>
MMOG, and two of these in particular. The first was an early leader in this<br/>space—There. The second is a growing and extraordinary success—Second<br/>Life.<br/>
Second Life is, as its website describes, “a 3-D virtual world entirely<br/>
built and owned by its residents.” <i>3-D </i>in the sense that the experience seems<br/>three dimensional—the characters and the objects appear to be in three<br/>dimensions. A <i>virtual </i>world in the sense that the objects and people are<br/>rendered by computers. <i>Built </i>by its residents in the sense that Second Life<br/>merely provided a platform upon which its residents built the Second Life<br/>world. (And not just a few. On any given day, 15 percent of Second Life res-<br/>idents are editing the scripts that make Second Life run.49 That platform<br/>originally rendered beautiful green fields. Residents acquired land in that<br/>world, and began building structures.) And <i>owned </i>by its residents in the<br/>sense that the stuff that the residents of Second Life build is theirs—both<br/>the “physical” thing itself (the car, or the surfboard, or the house), and any<br/>intellectual property right which might be embedded in that thing that they<br/>have built.<br/>
It is this last feature that contrasts most interestingly (for me at least)<br/>
with the other MMOG that I mentioned, There. There was also a community<br/>site. But it was a radically different (and less successful) world from Second<br/>Life. It was to be centered around corporate franchises—Sony or Nike, for<br/>

example, were expected to set up shop in There. People would also be allowed<br/>to create things in There, and when they sold or gave them away, There would<br/>get a percentage. The space itself came much more pre-fab, but there was sig-<br/>nificant opportunity for customization.<br/>
Its founders crafted the rhetoric of There at least around (at least their<br/>
understanding of) the ideals of the United States. The exchange rate for<br/>There-bucks was 1787 to 1—1787 being the year the United States Constitu-<br/>tion was written. And as the then-CEO of There explained to a class I was<br/>teaching, the values of the American republic informed the values of There.<br/>
My students were skeptical. And one fantastically bright student, Cather-<br/>
ine Crump, gave the CEO a bit of a rough ride. She asked whether There<br/>would respect the principles of the First Amendment. “Of course,” responded<br/>the CEO. “Would a citizen of There be allowed to put a sign on his land?”“Of<br/>course.” “Would she be allowed to buy land next to, say, Nike?” “Of course.”<br/>“Would she be allowed to put a sign up on her land next to Nike that says<br/>‘Nike uses sweatshop labor’?” “Umm. I’m not sure about that.” So much for<br/>the First Amendment.<br/>
Or more relevantly to Second Life, Crump asked, “Who owns the IP<br/>
[intellectual property] in the designs a citizen creates?” “There does.” “Who<br/>owns the IP in the designs Nike creates?”“Of course, Nike does. How could it<br/>be any other way?” Well, it could be another way if you followed the principles<br/>of the American Constitution, Crump suggested, which said IP rights get<br/>vested in “authors or inventors,” not in corporations.<br/>
There’s real problem, however, was structural. It is the same problem of<br/>
any planned or centralized economy. There was to be built by There, Inc. And<br/>therein was its problem. The structures of these virtual worlds are extraordi-<br/>narily complex. The cost of building them is immense, and thus There, Inc.<br/>faced a huge capital cost in making There run.<br/>
Second Life (like all new nations) outsourced that cost of construction to<br/>
its citizens. When you buy land in Second Life, you get an empty field or<br/>deserted island. You then have to buy, barter, or build to make it habitable.<br/>There’s an economy to building it, and it can be hard work. But the things you<br/>build you can sell. And again, the designs you make are yours. More than<br/>100,000 people now inhabit, and construct, Second Life. For them, the game<br/>is what it says.<br/>
These current rules, however, are the product of an evolution in Second<br/>
Life. In the first public Alpha testing of the site that would become Second<br/>Life, there was no concept of land ownership. Everything was public. The<br/>ownership of land began with Beta testing, when all users could claim the<br/>public land at a price. When the land was claimed, the user could select<br/>

110<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
whether others could create objects, scripts, or landmarks for the land. Later<br/>the options were extended.<br/>
In version 1.1, there was a fairly major change to the physics of land.<br/>
Whereas before users were free to teleport anywhere, now, to avoid harass-<br/>ment, owners of land could decide whether others could “trespass” or not—<br/>either by setting a default to grant or deny access, or by adding a list of people<br/>who were free to visit. These restrictions, however, applied only to the first 15<br/>meters above the property. Beyond that, anyone was free to fly, even if the<br/>owner didn’t want them on the property.<br/>
Now this last restriction has an interesting parallel to the history of Amer-<br/>
ican law. As I describe in <i>Free Culture,</i>50 property law in the American tradi-<br/>tion considered the owner of land the owner of the space from the ground “an<br/>indefinite extent, upwards.”51 This created an obvious conflict when airplanes<br/>appeared. Did the pilot of an airplane trespass when he flew over your land?<br/>
The accommodation the law eventually drew was between flying very<br/>
low and flying very high. It was not trespassing to fly very high over someone’s<br/>land; it was a nuisance to fly very low over someone’s land. So something like<br/>the solution that Second Life achieved was also achieved by the law.<br/>
But notice the important difference. In real space, the law means you can<br/>
be penalized for violating the “high/low” rule. In Second Life, you simply<br/>can’t violate the 15-meter rule. The rule is part of the code. The code controls<br/>how you are in Second Life. There isn’t a choice about obeying the rule or not,<br/>any more than there’s a choice about obeying gravity.<br/>
So code is law here. That code/law enforces its control directly. But obvi-<br/>
ously, this code (like law) changes. The key is to recognize that this change in<br/>the code is (unlike the laws of nature) crafted to reflect choices and values of<br/>the coders.<br/>
Consider another illustration of the same point. As I said, Second Life<br/>
gives the creators of Intellectual Property in Second Life ownership of that<br/>property—both inside and outside Second Life.52 (As one of the founders<br/>described, “Our lawyers shook their heads, but we decided the future of our<br/>company isn’t tied up in our owning what our users create.”53) That’s the<br/>same with IP in real space: Unless you’ve signed your rights away to a corpo-<br/>ration (don’t!), when you create in real space, the law automatically gives you<br/>a copyright in your creativity. In both spaces, too, you have the right to give<br/>those rights away. I run a nonprofit called Creative Commons that makes it<br/>simple for creators to signal the freedoms they want to run with their creativ-<br/>ity. In real space, when you use a Creative Commons license, you mark your<br/>content with the license you want. Users then know the freedoms they have.<br/>If a right is violated, it gets remedied through the law.<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
111<br/>
Second Life has taken this idea one step further. Creators in Second Life<br/>
can mark their content with the license they want. But the wizards of this<br/>world are exploring the idea that the license they’ve selected could affect<br/>directly what others can do with that creativity. If content is marked with a<br/>Creative Commons license, then someone can take a picture of it without<br/>express permission. But if it is not marked with a license, then if you try to<br/>take a picture of it, the object will be invisible. Here again, the code expresses<br/>the law more effectively than the law in real space ever could.<br/>
The Internet<br/>
As I said, we can distinguish cyberspace from the Internet. But the point of<br/>this chapter, however clear with respect to cyberspace, is still true of the Inter-<br/>net. There are architectural features of the Internet that embed certain values.<br/>Those features can also change, and if they do, the values the Internet pro-<br/>motes will be different.<br/>
The most significant example of this is one I only mentioned in the first<br/>
edition of this book, but which was at the center of <i>The Future of Ideas</i>. This<br/>is the “end-to-end” principle described by network architects Jerome Saltzer,<br/>David Clark, and David Reed in 1981.54 The end-to-end (“e2e”) principle is a<br/>design philosophy about how networks should be built. It counsels that a<br/>network should be kept as simple as possible and that the intelligence required<br/>in a network be vested in the edge, or ends of a network, at least so far as that’s<br/>possible.<br/>
As I’ve already described, the Internet embodied this principle by keeping<br/>
the functionality of TCP/IP focused quite narrowly—that is, on the single<br/>function best-efforts delivery of packets of data. What those packets do, or<br/>who they’re meant for, is not a concern of the protocol. Just delivering packets<br/>is the end.<br/>
One consequence of this design, then, is that people can innovate for this<br/>
network without any need to coordinate with any network owner. If you want<br/>to develop an application to deliver voice across IP, then all you need to do is<br/>to write the application to use the TCP/IP protocols to send data across the<br/>network in a way that will make your application run.<br/>
This design embeds a value that encourages innovation in applications<br/>
for the network. It does so both because it minimizes the costs of developing<br/>new applications (you don’t need the hassle of asking or clearing permission<br/>with anyone) and because it avoids strategic behavior by the network owner.<br/>Consider again the idea of developing a Voice-over-IP application. If the net-<br/>work is owned by the telephone companies, they would not be excited about<br/>

112<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
an application that will cannibalize their telephone market. Thus, if permis-<br/>sion were required before the VOIP application could be deployed, we might<br/>well expect the VOIP application not to be deployed—either because some-<br/>one developed it, but it was blocked, or because smart developers knew it was<br/>a waste of time to develop it, because it would be blocked. As Susan Crawford<br/>describes, “The miraculous growth of the Internet has in large part come<br/>from the nondiscrimination against higher levels. . . . Innovators at the appli-<br/>cation layer have been able to assume the continued stable existence of the<br/>lower layers.”55<br/>
The value here is innovation and competition. The network empowers<br/>
the widest range of innovators—users of the network—and entitles all of<br/>them to innovate for this network. Any innovation can be deployed on the<br/>network (so long as it respects the TCP/IP protocols). If users of the network<br/>like the innovation, then the innovation is a success.<br/>
Simultaneously—at least so long as the e2e principle is respected—this<br/>
design disables the potentially most powerful actor in the network, the net-<br/>work owner, from interfering with the opportunity for innovation within the<br/>network. The network owner might not like the stuff being developed, but e2e<br/>disables the opportunity to block that development.<br/>
In the same way that the original TCP/IP network could be effectively<br/>
changed so that “gaps” in information about that network could be closed, the<br/>TCP/IP network could be changed to remove its e2e character. Indeed, the<br/>very tools that I described in Chapter 4 could have this effect. For example, a<br/>network owner could scan the packets that were traveling across its network<br/>and block any packet that didn’t come from a known, or approved, applica-<br/>tion. To get on that list, application developers would have to contact the net-<br/>work owner and ask to be included on the list. That change to the way the<br/>Internet functions is completely technically possible. Indeed, versions of it<br/>are being pursued for both competitive and security reasons. That is, some<br/>networks, keen to control the kind of applications that run on the network for<br/>competitive reasons, could use this to block disfavored applications (again,<br/>think of telephone companies blocking VOIP). Others, keen to avoid viruses<br/>or other trouble on their network, could simply decide to block everything to<br/>make life simple. Either reason would produce the same result: that innova-<br/>tion on the Internet would be stifled.<br/>
As with the stories about “cyberspace,” this case about the Internet also<br/>
demonstrates the link between architecture and policy. End-to-end is a para-<br/>digm for technology that embeds values. Which architecture we encourage is<br/>a choice about which policy we encourage. This is true even in the context in<br/>which the Internet is not a “place”—even where, that is, it is “just” a medium.<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
113<br/>
HOW ARCHITECTURES MATTER AND SPACES DIFFER<br/>
The spaces I have described here are different. In some places there is commu-<br/>nity—a set of norms that are self-enforcing (by members of the community).<br/>Features such as visibility (as opposed to anonymity) and nontransience help<br/>create those norms; anonymity, transience, and diversity make it harder to<br/>create community.<br/>
In places where community is not fully self-enforcing, norms are supple-<br/>
mented by rules imposed either through code or by the relevant sovereign.<br/>These supplements may further some normative end, but at times they can be<br/>in tension with the goal of community building.<br/>
If we had to simplify this diversity of spaces by finding a dimension along<br/>
which we could rank them, one such dimension might be each group’s<br/>amenability to control. Some groups on this list can be controlled only<br/>through norms—.law.cyber, for example. The only technology for changing<br/>behavior there—given my commitment not to monitor and punish bad<br/>behavior—was the norms of the students in the law school class. Other<br/>groups are amenable to other technologies of control. Indeed, as we move<br/>from .law.cyber to CC to LambdaMOO to AOL to Second Life, the ability to<br/>use these other technologies of control increases, though, of course, that abil-<br/>ity is constrained by competition. If the code makes the place no longer<br/>attractive, people will leave.<br/>
Thus, in CC and AOL, the architects could use technology to change<br/>
behavior. But if the change is too far removed from what most members think<br/>the space is about, members may simply leave. The threat of that constraint<br/>turns upon the alternatives, of course. As blogs have flourished, a space like<br/>CC would have relatively little market power. AOL’s market power is more<br/>complicated. There are many alternative ISPs, of course. But once you’re a<br/>member of one, the costs of migrating are significant.<br/>
In LambdaMOO the story is even more complicated. Nothing really<br/>
binds people to a particular MOO. (There are hundreds, and most are free.)<br/>But because characters in a MOO are earned rather than bought, and because<br/>this takes time and characters are not fungible, it becomes increasingly hard<br/>for members of a successful MOO to move elsewhere. They have the right to<br/>exit, but in the sense that Soviet citizens had the right to exit—namely, with<br/>none of the assets they had built in their particular world.<br/>
Finally, Second Life offers the potential for the most control. Code regu-<br/>
lates experience in Second Life more than in any of the other four spaces,<br/>and the intimacy of experience in Second Life pulls people into the space and<br/>makes escape costly. Again, there are limits to the control, but the controls are<br/>

114<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
more finely articulated here than in any of the other contexts. And if Philip<br/>Rosedale, the CEO of Second Life, is to be believed, the control through code<br/>here will only become more subtly expressed. As he described to me:<br/>
[O]ur feeling is . . . that we should aggressively move into code anything we can,<br/>
because of the enhanced scalability it gives us. And we should execute policy out-<br/>
side of code only when absolutely necessary or unfeasible. There are things<br/>
where we look at them and we say, “Well, we’ll be able to do that in code some<br/>
day, but for today, we’re just going to do it by hand.”56<br/>
REGULATING CODE TO REGULATE BETTER<br/>
I’ve surveyed a range of cyberspaces to make clear the elements of regulation<br/>within each. One increasingly important element is code. In cyberspace in<br/>particular, but across the Internet in general, code embeds values. It enables,<br/>or not, certain control. And as has been the focus of this part, it is also a tool<br/>of control—not of government control, at least in the cases I’ve surveyed—<br/>but instead control to the end of whatever sovereign does the coding.<br/>
These stories suggest a technique, and once we see the idea, we’ll recog-<br/>
nize the technique in many different contexts of regulation. If Second Life can<br/>use code to better control behavior, what about first-life? If AOL can use code<br/>to better control fraud, what about America off-line? If the Internet can use<br/>the design of e2e to better enable competition, what does that teach regulators<br/>on the ground? How do these techniques of policy inform the practice of<br/>policy makers?<br/>
The answer is that policy makers have done the same in real space for a<br/>
long time. Just as Chapter 5 described regulators using code to make behavior<br/>more regulable, so too have regulators used code to directly control behavior.<br/>Consider a few obvious examples:<br/>
Tapes<br/>
The most significant feature of digital media is that copies can be perfect.<br/>Digital media is just data, and data is just a string of 1’s and 0’s. Computers<br/>have complex algorithms to verify that when they’ve copied a string of data<br/>they’ve copied that string precisely.<br/>
This feature thus creates a new risk for sellers of content. While the code<br/>
of analog copying technology meant that a copy was a degraded version of the<br/>original, the code of digital technologies means that a copy could be identical<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
115<br/>
to the original. That means the threat to content providers from “copies” is<br/>greater in the digital world than in the analog world.<br/>
Digital Audio Technology (DAT) was the first technology to expose this<br/>
risk. Like any digital recording, it can, in principle, copy content perfectly.<br/>Content providers were thus terrified that piracy from DAT tapes would<br/>destroy their industry, so they lobbied Congress effectively to add new laws to<br/>protect them from the digital threat.<br/>
Congress could have responded to their request in any number of ways.<br/>
It could have used law to regulate behavior directly, by increasing the penalty<br/>for illegal copying. It could have funded a public ad campaign against illegal<br/>copying or funded programs in schools to discourage students from buying<br/>pirated editions of popular recordings. Congress could have taxed blank tapes<br/>and then transferred the revenue to owners of copyrighted material.57 Or<br/>Congress could have tried to regulate DAT technology to weaken the threat<br/>that technology presented for copyright.<br/>
Congress chose the latter two. The Audio Home Recording Act both taxed<br/>
blank tapes slightly and regulated the code of digital reproduction technolo-<br/>gies directly. The Act requires producers of digital recording devices to install<br/>a chip in their systems that implements a code-based system to monitor the<br/>copies of any copy made on that machine.58 The chip would allow a limited<br/>number of personal copies, but on copies of copies, the quality of the record-<br/>ing would be degraded. Congress in essence required that the code of digital<br/>copying be modified to restore the imperfections that were “natural” in the<br/>earlier code.<br/>
This again is Congress regulating code as a means of regulating behav-<br/>
ior—mandating that multiple copies be imperfect as a way to minimize illegal<br/>copying. Like the telephone regulation, this regulation succeeds because there<br/>are relatively few manufacturers of DAT technology. Again, given a limited tar-<br/>get, the government’s regulation can be effective, and the effect of the govern-<br/>ment’s regulation is to make more regulable the primary targeted<br/>behavior—copyright infringement.<br/>
Televisions<br/>
By the mid-1990s, parents’ concern about the effect that violence on television<br/>has on their kids had caught the attention of Congress, and Congress<br/>responded through legislation. But given the state of First Amendment law, it<br/>would have been difficult for Congress to block violence on television directly.<br/>Thus, Congress sought a way to block violence on television indirectly. It<br/>sought to require that those broadcasting television content tag their content<br/>

116<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
with labels that signaled the level of violence in the film, and it mandated<br/>that the television industry develop a technology to block content on the<br/>basis of those labels.<br/>
This was the “V-Chip,” mandated as part of the Telecommunications Act<br/>
of 1996.59 The V-chip would facilitate the automatic blocking of television<br/>broadcasts, based on criteria of content that have not yet been completely<br/>determined. The crudest proposals involve something like the Motion Picture<br/>Association’s movie rating system; the more sophisticated envision selections<br/>based on a much richer set of factors.<br/>
This again is Congress regulating code to affect a targeted behavior (pro-<br/>
viding violent programming) rather than regulating that behavior directly.<br/>The constraint on direct regulation here is similarly a regulability problem.<br/>But the lack of regulability in this context comes from constitutional limits,<br/>not the inability to track those being regulated by the technology. The con-<br/>straint of the Constitution thus pushed Congress to require technology to<br/>empower parents. By giving parents more power to discriminate, Congress<br/>indirectly discourages an ill (exposure to violence) that it is constitutionally<br/>unable to regulate directly.60<br/>
Anti-Circumvention<br/>
Whatever problem the content industry had with DAT tapes, no doubt they<br/>look tiny compared with the problems the content industry has with digital<br/>content and the Internet. Although DAT makes perfect copies possible, it<br/>doesn’t make distributing those perfect copies any easier. That honor fell to<br/>the Internet. Now digital technology not only assured perfect copies of the<br/>original, it also made it trivial to distribute those digital copies for free.<br/>
As I describe more in Chapter 10, one response to this “feature” of digital<br/>
technologies is “digital rights management” technology. DRM technologies<br/>add code to digital content that disables the simple ability to copy or distrib-<br/>ute that content—at least without the technical permission of the DRM tech-<br/>nology itself.<br/>
Thus, the songs I’ve purchased and downloaded from Apple’s iTunes<br/>
music store are protected by Apple’s “fairplay” DRM technology. That tech-<br/>nology permits me to copy the song to a limited number of machines, but it<br/>restricts my ability to copy those songs broadly.<br/>
This restriction is effected through code. The “copy” function is produced<br/>
through code; the DRM technology modifies, or qualifies, that “copy” func-<br/>tionality. It is thus a classic example of code being deployed to restore control<br/>over something that (different) code had disabled.<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
117<br/>
These systems of DRM are privately created. But in 1998, they got an<br/>
important subsidy of protection from Congress. In the Digital Millennium<br/>Copyright Act, Congress banned the creation and distribution of technologies<br/>“produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that<br/>effectively controls access” to a copyrighted work, or “primarily designed or<br/>produced for the purpose of circumventing protection afforded by a techno-<br/>logical measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner.”61 By<br/>banning this code, Congress aimed to add support to the code content cre-<br/>ators were distributing to protect their content. Thus, by directly regulating<br/>code, Congress indirectly regulated copyright infringement.<br/>
Since this enactment, there has been no end to trouble and litigation<br/>
surrounding it. Beginning in 1999, the DVD-Copy Control Association<br/>began suing individuals and websites that facilitated access to a program,<br/>DeCSS, which could be used to decrypt data on DVDs.62 In July 2001, 27-<br/>year-old Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested while giving a<br/>presentation in Las Vegas because the company he worked for in Russia<br/>had produced software that enabled people to circumvent the access protec-<br/>tion technologies built into Adobe’s eBook system.63 Sklyarov spent six<br/>months in an American jail before he was permitted to return to his family<br/>in Russia.<br/>
The effect of this regulation is hard to measure. The Electronic Frontier<br/>
Foundation has cataloged its view of the law’s effect five years after the law was<br/>enacted.64 And while the EFF’s view may not be universal, there is a fairly<br/>universal surprise at the range of cases that have been brought under the<br/>statute. (I doubt the framers of the DMCA imagined that garage door com-<br/>panies would be suing to protect their automatic door openers from compe-<br/>tition under the DMCA (they lost).65)<br/>
Broadcast Flags<br/>
As broadcast television moves to digital television, copyright holders have<br/>become concerned about the risk they face in broadcasting copyrighted con-<br/>tent. Unlike an ordinary television broadcast, the quality of a digital broadcast<br/>is perfect, so copies of digital broadcasts could likewise be perfect. And the<br/>spread of perfect copies of digital broadcasts on a free digital network (the<br/>Internet) terrifies copyright holders.<br/>
Their response is similar to the response with DAT technologies. First in<br/>
the FCC, and now in Congress, copyright holders have pushed the govern-<br/>ment to mandate that any technology capable of reproducing digital broad-<br/>casts be architected to respect a “broadcast flag.” If that flag was turned on,<br/>

118<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
then the technology would be required to block any copy of that content.<br/>The content could be played, but it couldn’t be reproduced. As Susan Craw-<br/>ford describes it,<br/>
The broadcast flag rule, distilled to its essence, is a mandate that all consumer<br/>
electronics manufacturers and information technology companies ensure that<br/>
any device that touches digital television content “recognized and give effect to”<br/>
the flag by protecting content against unauthorized onward distribution. The<br/>
FCC claimed that the rule would protect digital television (“DTV”) broadcasts<br/>
from massive redistribution over the Internet.66<br/>
There is a lot to say about the broadcast flag, and if I were doing the say-<br/>
ing, most of it would be bad.67 But for our purposes, it is the form, not sub-<br/>stance, of the broadcast flag that is relevant. This is the most direct example<br/>of a regulation of code designed to control primary behavior: law regulating<br/>code to make behavior better.<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
In each case, the government directs an intermediary that has some power<br/>over code to change that code to effect a change in behavior. Whether that<br/>change in code will effect a change in behavior depends upon the power of the<br/>particular application. If the application is a MOO, or an online discussion<br/>space like Counsel Connect, the power to control behavior is significantly<br/>limited. If the application is AOL or Second Life, the exit costs for a user could<br/>well be higher. The scope for effective regulation will thus be greater. And if<br/>the application is the Internet, or any digital technology produced or sold in<br/>the United States, then the power of the regulator is greater still. Code<br/>becomes law even if there remains a capacity to escape the regulation of that<br/>code.<br/>
These examples point to a general question about how regulation will<br/>
function. That general point requires many significant qualifications. To<br/>understand the effect of code requirements on any regulatory policy will<br/>require, as Polk Wagner writes, an understanding that is “profoundly<br/>dynamic.”68 Part of that dynamic, of course, is resistance. Individuals can act<br/>to resist the force of code directly. Or individuals can act to resist the force of<br/>code through code. As Tim Wu has rightly described, code itself is not neces-<br/>sarily regulation enhancing—code can be used to foil regulation. A gun is a bit<br/>of code. It works wonders to destroy the peace. Circumvention technologies<br/>are code. They weaken rules reinforcing control. P2P filesharing protocols<br/>are code. They undermine the effectiveness of copyright regulations that<br/>restrict the freedom to distribute copyrighted works. Whether a particular<br/>

cyberspaces<br/>
119<br/>
regulation will be effective, then, requires consideration of these interactions,<br/>and any code-based resistance it might engender. As Wu puts it,<br/>
The reason that code matters for law at all is its capability to define behavior on<br/>
a mass scale. This capability can mean constraints on behavior, in which case<br/>
code regulates. But it can also mean shaping behavior into legally advantageous<br/>
forms.69<br/>
In this second sense, code functions “as an anti-regulatory mechanism: a<br/>
tool to minimize the costs of law that certain groups will use to their advan-<br/>tage.”70<br/>
More fundamentally, these complications suggest that a more general<br/>
framework is needed. I’ve highlighted an interaction between technology,<br/>policy, and the law in this chapter. That interaction suggests a much broader<br/>model. In the next chapter, I describe that model. In the chapter following<br/>that, we will return to the dynamic of code regulation to consider one other<br/>important qualification.<br/>

JOHN STUART MILL WAS AN ENGLISHMAN. HE WAS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST<br/>influential political philosophers in America. His writings ranged from<br/>important work on logic to a still striking text about sexual equality, <i>The Sub-<br/>jection of Women</i>. But perhaps his most important continuing influence<br/>comes from a relatively short book titled <i>On Liberty</i>. Published in 1859, this<br/>powerful argument for individual liberty and diversity of thought represents<br/>an important view of liberal and libertarian thinking in the second half of the<br/>nineteenth century.<br/>
“Libertarian,” however, has a specific meaning for us. For most, it associ-<br/>
ates with arguments against government.1 Government, in the modern liber-<br/>tarian’s view, is the threat to liberty; private action is not. Thus, the good<br/>libertarian is focused on reducing government’s power. Curb the excesses of<br/>government, the libertarian says, and you will ensure freedom for your society.<br/>
Mill’s view was not so narrow. He was a defender of liberty and an oppo-<br/>
nent of forces that suppressed it, but those forces were not confined to govern-<br/>ment. Liberty, in Mill’s view, was threatened as much by norms as by<br/>government, as much by stigma and intolerance as by the threat of state pun-<br/>ishment. His objective was to argue against these private forces of coercion.<br/>His work was a defense against liberty-suppressing norms, because, in Eng-<br/>land at that time, these were the real threat to liberty.<br/>
Mill’s method is important, and it should be our own as well. It asks,<br/>
What is the threat to liberty, and how can we resist it? It is not limited to ask-<br/>ing, What is the threat to liberty from government? It understands that more<br/>than government can threaten liberty, and that sometimes this something<br/>more can be private rather than state action. Mill was not concerned with the<br/>source of the threat to liberty. His concern was with liberty.<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
121<br/>
Threats to liberty change. In England, norms may have been the threat to free<br/>
speech in the late nineteenth century; I take it they are not as much a threat today.<br/>In the United States in the first two decades of the twentieth century, the threat to<br/>free speech was state suppression through criminal penalties for unpopular<br/>speech; the strong protections of the First Amendment now make that particular<br/>threat less significant.2 The labor movement was founded on the idea that the<br/>market is sometimes a threat to liberty—not so much because of low wages, but<br/>because the market form of organization itself disables a certain kind of freedom.3<br/>In other societies, at other times, the market is a key to liberty, not the enemy.<br/>
Thus, rather than think of “liberty’s enemy” in the abstract, we should focus<br/>
upon a particular threat to liberty that might exist in a particular time and<br/>place. And this is especially true when we think about liberty in cyberspace. I<br/>believe that cyberspace creates a new threat to liberty, not new in the sense that<br/>no theorist had conceived of it before,4 but new in the sense of newly urgent. We<br/>are coming to understand a newly powerful regulator in cyberspace. That reg-<br/>ulator could be a significant threat to a wide range of liberties, and we don’t yet<br/>understand how best to control it.<br/>
This regulator is what I call “code”—the instructions embedded in the soft-<br/>
ware or hardware that makes cyberspace what it is. This code is the “built envi-<br/>ronment” of social life in cyberspace. It is its “architecture.”5 And if in the middle<br/>of the nineteenth century the threat to liberty was norms, and at the start of the<br/>twentieth it was state power, and during much of the middle twentieth it was the<br/>market, then my argument is that we must come to understand how in the<br/>twenty-first century it is a different regulator—code—that should be our cur-<br/>rent concern.<br/>
But not to the exclusion of other significant “regulators.” My argument is<br/>
not that there’s only one threat to liberty, or that we should forget other, more<br/>traditional threats. It is instead that we must add one more increasingly salient<br/>threat to the list. And to see this new, salient threat, I believe we need a more<br/>general understanding of how regulation works—one that focuses on more<br/>than the single influence of any one force such as government, norms, or the<br/>market, and instead integrates these factors into a single account.<br/>
This chapter is a step toward that more general understanding.6 It is an<br/>
invitation to think beyond the threat to liberty from government power. It is a<br/>map for this more general understanding.<br/>
A DOT’S LIFE<br/>
There are many ways to think about “regulation.” I want to think about it<br/>from the perspective of someone who is regulated, or, what is different, con-<br/>

strained. That someone regulated is represented by this (pathetic) dot—a<br/>creature (you or me) subject to different regulations that might have the effect<br/>of constraining (or as we’ll see, enabling) the dot’s behavior. By describing the<br/>various constraints that might bear on this individual, I hope to show you<br/>something about how these constraints function together.<br/>
Here then is the dot.<br/>
How is this dot “regulated”?<br/>Let’s start with something easy: smoking. If you want to smoke, what<br/>
constraints do you face? What factors regulate your decision to smoke or not?<br/>
One constraint is legal. In some places at least, laws regulate smoking—if<br/>
you are under eighteen, the law says that cigarettes cannot be sold to you. If<br/>you are under twenty-six, cigarettes cannot be sold to you unless the seller<br/>checks your ID. Laws also regulate where smoking is permitted—not in<br/>O’Hare Airport, on an airplane, or in an elevator, for instance. In these two<br/>ways at least, laws aim to direct smoking behavior. They operate as a kind of<br/>constraint on an individual who wants to smoke.<br/>
But laws are not the most significant constraints on smoking. Smokers in<br/>
the United States certainly feel their freedom regulated, even if only rarely by<br/>the law. There are no smoking police, and smoking courts are still quite rare.<br/>Rather, smokers in America are regulated by norms. Norms say that one<br/>doesn’t light a cigarette in a private car without first asking permission of the<br/>other passengers. They also say, however, that one needn’t ask permission to<br/>smoke at a picnic. Norms say that others can ask you to stop smoking at a<br/>restaurant, or that you never smoke during a meal. These norms effect a certain<br/>constraint, and this constraint regulates smoking behavior.<br/>
Laws and norms are still not the only forces regulating smoking behavior.<br/>
The market is also a constraint. The price of cigarettes is a constraint on your<br/>ability to smoke—change the price, and you change this constraint. Likewise<br/>with quality. If the market supplies a variety of cigarettes of widely varying<br/>quality and price, your ability to select the kind of cigarette you want<br/>increases; increasing choice here reduces constraint.<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
123<br/>
Finally, there are the constraints created by the technology of cigarettes, or<br/>
by the technologies affecting their supply.7 Nicotine-treated cigarettes are<br/>addictive and therefore create a greater constraint on smoking than untreated<br/>cigarettes. Smokeless cigarettes present less of a constraint because they can be<br/>smoked in more places. Cigarettes with a strong odor present more of a con-<br/>straint because they can be smoked in fewer places. How the cigarette is, how<br/>it is designed, how it is built—in a word, its architecture—affects the con-<br/>straints faced by a smoker.<br/>
Thus, four constraints regulate this pathetic dot—the law, social norms,<br/>
the market, and architecture—and the “regulation” of this dot is the sum of<br/>these four constraints. Changes in any one will affect the regulation of the<br/>whole. Some constraints will support others; some may undermine others.<br/>Thus, “changes in technology [may] usher in changes in . . . norms,”8 and the<br/>other way around. A complete view, therefore, must consider these four<br/>modalities together.<br/>
So think of the four together like this:<br/>
In this drawing, each oval represents one kind of constraint operating<br/>
on our pathetic dot in the center. Each constraint imposes a different kind of<br/>cost on the dot for engaging in the relevant behavior—in this case, smoking.<br/>The cost from norms is different from the market cost, which is different<br/>from the cost from law and the cost from the (cancerous) architecture of cig-<br/>arettes.<br/>

124<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
The constraints are distinct, yet they are plainly interdependent. Each<br/>
can support or oppose the others. Technologies can undermine norms and<br/>laws; they can also support them. Some constraints make others possible;<br/>others make some impossible. Constraints work together, though they func-<br/>tion differently and the effect of each is distinct. Norms constrain through the<br/>stigma that a community imposes; markets constrain through the price that<br/>they exact; architectures constrain through the physical burdens they impose;<br/>and law constrains through the punishment it threatens.<br/>
We can call each constraint a “regulator,” and we can think of each as a<br/>
distinct modality of regulation. Each modality has a complex nature, and the<br/>interaction among these four is also hard to describe. I’ve worked through this<br/>complexity more completely in the appendix. But for now, it is enough to<br/>see that they are linked and that, in a sense, they combine to produce the reg-<br/>ulation to which our pathetic dot is subject in any given area.<br/>
We can use the same model to describe the regulation of behavior in<br/>
cyberspace.9<br/>
Law regulates behavior in cyberspace. Copyright law, defamation law, and<br/>
obscenity laws all continue to threaten ex post sanction for the violation of<br/>legal rights. How well law regulates, or how efficiently, is a different question:<br/>In some cases it does so more efficiently, in some cases less. But whether better<br/>or not, law continues to threaten a certain consequence if it is defied. Legisla-<br/>tures enact;10 prosecutors threaten;11 courts convict.12<br/>
Norms also regulate behavior in cyberspace. Talk about Democratic pol-<br/>
itics in the alt.knitting newsgroup, and you open yourself to flaming; “spoof ”<br/>someone’s identity in a MUD, and you may find yourself “toaded”;13 talk too<br/>much in a discussion list, and you are likely to be placed on a common bozo<br/>filter. In each case, a set of understandings constrain behavior, again through<br/>the threat of ex post sanctions imposed by a community.14<br/>
Markets regulate behavior in cyberspace. Pricing structures constrain<br/>
access, and if they do not, busy signals do. (AOL learned this quite dramati-<br/>cally when it shifted from an hourly to a flat-rate pricing plan.)15 Areas of the<br/>Web are beginning to charge for access, as online services have for some time.<br/>Advertisers reward popular sites; online services drop low-population forums.<br/>These behaviors are all a function of market constraints and market opportu-<br/>nity. They are all, in this sense, regulations of the market.<br/>
Finally, an analog for architecture regulates behavior in cyberspace—<br/>
code. The software and hardware that make cyberspace what it is constitute a<br/>set of constraints on how you can behave. The substance of these constraints<br/>may vary, but they are experienced as conditions on your access to cyberspace.<br/>In some places (online services such as AOL, for instance) you must enter a<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
125<br/>
password before you gain access; in other places you can enter whether iden-<br/>tified or not.16 In some places the transactions you engage in produce traces<br/>that link the transactions (the “mouse droppings”) back to you; in other<br/>places this link is achieved only if you want it to be.17 In some places you can<br/>choose to speak a language that only the recipient can hear (through encryp-<br/>tion);18 in other places encryption is not an option.19 The code or software or<br/>architecture or protocols set these features, which are selected by code writers.<br/>They constrain some behavior by making other behavior possible or impos-<br/>sible. The code embeds certain values or makes certain values impossible. In<br/>this sense, it too is regulation, just as the architectures of real-space codes are<br/>regulations.<br/>
As in real space, then, these four modalities regulate cyberspace. The same<br/>
balance exists. As William Mitchell puts it (though he omits the constraint of<br/>the market):<br/>
Architecture, laws, and customs maintain and represent whatever balance has<br/>
been struck in real space. As we construct and inhabit cyberspace communities,<br/>
we will have to make and maintain similar bargains—though they will be<br/>
embodied in software structures and electronic access controls rather than in<br/>
architectural arrangements.20<br/>
Laws, norms, the market, and architectures interact to build the environ-<br/>
ment that “Netizens” know. The code writer, as Ethan Katsh puts it, is the<br/>“architect.”21<br/>
But how can we “make and maintain” this balance between modalities?<br/>
What tools do we have to achieve a different construction? How might the<br/>mix of real-space values be carried over to the world of cyberspace? How<br/>might the mix be changed if change is desired?<br/>
ON GOVERNMENTS AND WAYS TO REGULATE<br/>
I’ve described four constraints that I’ve said “regulate” an individual. But<br/>these separate constraints obviously don’t simply exist as givens in a social<br/>life. They are neither found in nature nor fixed by God. Each can be<br/>changed, though the mechanics of changing them is complex. Law can<br/>have a significant role in this mechanics, and my aim in this section is to<br/>describe that role.<br/>
A simple example will suggest the more general point. Say the theft of<br/>
car radios is a problem—not big in the scale of things, but a frequent and<br/>costly enough problem to make more regulation necessary. One response<br/>

126<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
might be to increase the penalty for car radio theft to life in prison, so that<br/>the risk faced by thieves made it such that this crime did not pay. If radio<br/>thieves realized that they exposed themselves to a lifetime in prison each<br/>time they stole a radio, it might no longer make sense to them to steal<br/>radios. The constraint constituted by the threatened punishment of law<br/>would now be enough to stop the behavior we are trying to stop.<br/>
But changing the law is not the only possible technique. A second might<br/>
be to change the radio’s architecture. Imagine that radio manufacturers<br/>program radios to work only with a single car—a security code that elec-<br/>tronically locks the radio to the car, so that, if the radio is removed, it will no<br/>longer work. This is a code constraint on the theft of radios; it makes the<br/>radio no longer effective once stolen. It too functions as a constraint on the<br/>radio’s theft, and like the threatened punishment of life in prison, it could be<br/>effective in stopping the radio-stealing behavior.<br/>
Thus, the same constraint can be achieved through different means,<br/>
and the different means cost different amounts. The threatened punishment<br/>of life in prison may be fiscally more costly than the change in the architec-<br/>ture of radios (depending on how many people actually continue to steal<br/>radios and how many are caught). From this fiscal perspective, it may be<br/>more efficient to change code than law. Fiscal efficiency may also align with<br/>the expressive content of law—a punishment so extreme would be barbaric<br/>for a crime so slight. Thus, the values may well track the efficient response.<br/>Code would be the best means to regulate.<br/>
The costs, however, need not align so well. Take the Supreme Court’s<br/>
hypothetical example of life in prison for a parking ticket.22 It is likely that<br/>whatever code constraint might match this law constraint, the law con-<br/>straint would be more efficient (if reducing parking violations were the<br/>only aim). There would be very few victims of this law before people con-<br/>formed their behavior appropriately. But the “efficient result” would conflict<br/>with other values. If it is barbaric to incarcerate for life for the theft of a<br/>radio, it is all the more barbaric as a penalty for a parking violation. The reg-<br/>ulator has a range of means to effect the desired constraint, but the values<br/>that these means entail need not align with their efficiency. The efficient<br/>answer may well be unjust—that is, it may conflict with values inherent in<br/>the norms, or law (constitution), of the society.<br/>
Law-talk typically ignores these other regulators and how law can affect<br/>
their regulation. Many speak as if law must simply take the other three con-<br/>straints as given and fashion itself to them.23<br/>
I say “as if ” because today it takes only a second’s thought to see that this<br/>
narrowness is absurd. There were times when these other constraints were<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
127<br/>
treated as fixed—when the constraints of norms were said to be immovable<br/>by governmental action,24 or the market was thought to be essentially<br/>unregulable,25 or the cost of changing real-space code was so high as to<br/>make the thought of using it for regulation absurd.26 But we see now that<br/>these constraints are plastic.27 They are, as law is, changeable, and subject to<br/>regulation.<br/>
The examples are obvious and many. Think first about the market: talk of<br/>
a “free market” notwithstanding, there is no more heavily regulated aspect of<br/>our life.28 The market is regulated by law not just in its elements—it is law that<br/>enforces contracts, establishes property, and regulates currency—but also in<br/>its effects. The law uses taxes to increase the market’s constraint on certain<br/>behaviors and subsidies to reduce its constraint on others. We tax cigarettes in<br/>part to reduce their consumption, but we subsidize tobacco production to<br/>increase its supply. We tax alcohol to reduce its consumption. We subsidize<br/>child care to reduce the constraint the market puts on raising children. In<br/>many such ways the constraint of law is used to change the constraints of the<br/>market.<br/>
Law can also change the regulation of architecture. Think about the<br/>
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).29 Many of the “disabled” are cut off<br/>from access to much of the world. A building with only stairs is a building that<br/>is inaccessible to a person in a wheelchair; the stairs are a constraint on the<br/>disabled person’s access to that building. But the ADA in part aims to change<br/>that constraint by requiring builders to change the design of buildings so that<br/>the disabled are not excluded. Here is a regulation of real-space code, by law,<br/>to change the constraint that real-space code creates.<br/>
Other examples are even better.<br/>
• Some of the power of the French Revolution derived from the architecture of<br/>
Paris: The city’s small and winding streets were easily barricaded, making it<br/>
possible for revolutionaries to take control of the city with relatively little<br/>
absolute strength. Louis Napoleon III understood this, and in 1853 he took<br/>
steps to change it.30 Paris was rebuilt, with wide boulevards and multiple<br/>
passages, making it impossible for insurgents to take control of the city.<br/>
• Every schoolchild learns of L’Enfant’s design to make an invasion of Washing-<br/>
ton difficult. But more interesting is the placement of the White House rela-<br/>
tive to the Capitol. The distance between them is one mile, and at the time it<br/>
was a mile through difficult terrain (the mall was a swamp). The distance<br/>
was a barrier meant to tilt the intercourse between Congress and the presi-<br/>
dent by making it marginally more difficult for them to connect—and<br/>
thereby more difficult for the executive to control the legislature.<br/>

128<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
• This same idea has influenced the placement of constitutional courts in<br/>
Europe. Throughout Europe constitutional courts were placed in cities other<br/>
than the capital. In Germany the court is in Karlsruhe rather than Berlin; in<br/>
the Czech Republic it is in Brno rather than Prague. The reason again is tied<br/>
to the constraint of geography: Placing constitutional courts far away from<br/>
legislatures and executives was meant to minimize both the pressure the latter<br/>
two bodies could place on the court and reduce the court’s temptation to<br/>
bow to it.<br/>
• The principle is not limited to high politics. Designers of parking garages or<br/>
streets where children may play place speed bumps in the road so that drivers<br/>
must slow down. These structures have the same purpose as a speed limit or<br/>
a norm against driving too fast, but they operate by modifying architecture.<br/>
• Neither is the principle limited to virtuous regulation: Robert Moses built<br/>
bridges on Long Island to block buses, so that African Americans, who<br/>
depended primarily on public transportation, could not easily get to public<br/>
beaches.31 That was regulation through architecture, invidious yet familiar.<br/>
• Nor is it limited to governments. A major American airline noticed that pas-<br/>
sengers on early Monday morning flights were frustrated with the time it<br/>
took to retrieve bags from the plane. They were much more annoyed than<br/>
other passengers, even though it took no longer than average to retrieve the<br/>
bags from these flights. The company began parking these flights at gates far-<br/>
ther away from baggage claim, so that by the time the passengers arrived at<br/>
baggage claim, their bags were there. Frustration with the baggage handling<br/>
system was eliminated.<br/>
• A large hotel in an American city received many complaints about the slow-<br/>
ness of its elevators. It installed mirrors next to the elevator doors. The com-<br/>
plaints ended.<br/>
• Few are likely to recognize the leading regulation-through-architecture pro-<br/>
ponent of the 20th century—Ralph Nader. It is astonishing today to read his<br/>
account of the struggle to get safety standards enforced upon auto makers.<br/>
Nader’s whole objective was to get the law to force car manufacturers to build<br/>
safer cars. It is obvious today that the code of cars is an essential part of auto<br/>
safety. Yet on this basic point, there was fundamental disagreement.32<br/>
• Neal Katyal has extensively considered the relationship of architecture to<br/>
criminal law, from the deployment of street lights to the design of public<br/>
spaces to maximize visibility.33 The 2000 Sydney Olympics, for example, “self-<br/>
consciously employed architecture to reduce crime.”34 And architects have<br/>
begun to identify principles of design that can minimize crime—called<br/>
“Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design.”35<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
129<br/>
In each example, an architecture is changed so as to realize different behav-<br/>
ior. The architecture effects that difference. As a sign above one of the portals<br/>at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair put it (though it was speaking of science):<br/>“Science Explores: Technology Executes: Man Conforms.”36<br/>
Law can change social norms as well, though much of our constitutional<br/>
jurisprudence seems dedicated to forgetting just how.37 Education is the most<br/>obvious example. As Thurgood Marshall put it, “Education is not the teaching<br/>of the three R’s. Education is the teaching of the overall citizenship, to learn to<br/>live together with fellow citizens, and above all to learn to obey the law.”38 Edu-<br/>cation is, in part at least, a process through which we indoctrinate children into<br/>certain norms of behavior—we teach them how to “say no” to sex and drugs.<br/>We try to build within them a sense of what is correct. This sense then regulates<br/>them to the law’s end.<br/>
Plainly, the content of much of this education is regulated by law. Conser-<br/>
vatives worry, for example, that by teaching sex education we change the norm<br/>of sexual abstinence. Whether that is correct or not, the law is certainly being<br/>used to change the norms of children. If conservatives are correct, the law is<br/>eliminating abstinence. If liberals are correct, the law is being used to instill a<br/>norm of safe sex. Either way, norms have their own constraint, and law is aim-<br/>ing to change that constraint.<br/>
To say that law plays a role is not to say that it always plays a positive role.<br/>
The law can muck up norms as well as improve them, and I do not claim that<br/>the latter result is more common than the former.39 The point is just to see the<br/>role, not to praise or criticize it.<br/>
In each case, the law chooses between direct and indirect regulation. The<br/>
question is: Which means best advances the regulator’s goal, subject to the<br/>constraints (whether normative or material) that the regulator must recognize?<br/>My argument is that any analysis of the strategies of regulation must take into<br/>account these different modalities. As Polk Wagner puts it, focusing on one<br/>additional modality:<br/>
[J]ust as the choice of a legal rule will involve analytic trade offs between the<br/>
familiar categories of property rules and liability rules, the incorporation of legal<br/>
preemption rules in the cyberspace context will require a similar exercise along an<br/>
additional dimension—the impact that the legal rule will have on corresponding<br/>
software regulation (and thus the effect on the law-software interface).40<br/>
Or again, “legal policy proposals unsupported by predictions of techno-<br/>
logical response are deeply incomplete.”41 And the same can be said generally<br/>about the interaction between any modality and any policy proposal.<br/>

130<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
We can represent the point through a modification of the second figure:<br/>
As Wagner rightly insists, again, the interaction among these modalities is<br/>
dynamic, “requiring consideration of not only . . . legal adjustments, but also<br/>predicting the responsive effects such changes will stimulate.”42 The regulator<br/>seeks an “equilibrium,” constantly considering trade-offs among modalities of<br/>regulation.<br/>
The point should be familiar, and the examples can be multiplied.<br/><i>Seatbelts</i>: The government may want citizens to wear seatbelts more<br/>
often.43 It could pass a law to require the wearing of seatbelts (law regulating<br/>behavior directly). Or it could fund public education campaigns to create a<br/>stigma against those who do not wear seatbelts (law regulating social norms<br/>as a means to regulating behavior). Or it could subsidize insurance companies<br/>to offer reduced rates to seatbelt wearers (law regulating the market as a way<br/>of regulating behavior). Finally, the law could mandate automatic seatbelts, or<br/>ignition-locking systems (changing the code of the automobile as a means of<br/>regulating belting behavior). Each action might be said to have some effect on<br/>seatbelt use; each has some cost. The question for the government is how to<br/>get the most seatbelt use for the least cost.<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
131<br/>
<i>Discrimination against the disabled</i>: The disabled bear the burden of sig-<br/>
nificant social and physical barriers in daily life.44 The government might<br/>decide to do something about those barriers. The traditional answer is law<br/>regulating behavior directly: a law barring discrimination on the basis of<br/>physical disability. But the law could do more. It could, for example, educate<br/>children in order to change social norms (regulating norms to regulate behav-<br/>ior). It could subsidize companies to hire the disabled (regulating the market<br/>to regulate behavior). It could regulate building codes to make buildings more<br/>accessible to the disabled (regulating “natural” or real-space codes to regulate<br/>behavior). Each of these regulations would have some effect on discrimina-<br/>tion and would have a cost. The government would have to weigh the costs<br/>against the benefits and select the mode that regulates most effectively.<br/>
<i>Drugs</i>: The government is obsessed with reducing the consumption of<br/>
illicit drugs. Its main strategy has been direct regulation of behavior through<br/>the threat of barbaric prison terms for violation of the drug laws. This policy<br/>has obvious costs and non-obvious benefits. But most interesting for our<br/>purposes are the non-obvious costs. As Tracey Meares persuasively argues,<br/>one effective structure for regulating the consumption of illegal drugs is the<br/>social structure of the community in which an individual lives.45 These are<br/>what I’ve called social norm constraints: standards of appropriate behavior<br/>enforced by the sanctions of a community—whether through shame, exclu-<br/>sion, or force.<br/>
Just as government can act to strengthen these social norm constraints, it<br/>
should be obvious that government can also act to weaken them.46 One way<br/>to do this is by weakening the communities within which these norms oper-<br/>ate. This, says Meares, is what the extreme sanctions of the criminal law do.47<br/>In their extremity and effect, they undermine the social structures that would<br/>support this social policy. This is an indirect effect of the direct regulation of<br/>law, and at some point this effect may overwhelm the effect of the law. We<br/>might call this the Laffer Curve for criminal law.<br/>
The net effect of these different constraints cannot be deduced a priori.<br/>
The government acts in many ways to regulate the consumption of drugs. It<br/>supports extensive public education campaigns to stigmatize the consump-<br/>tion of drugs (regulating social norms to regulate behavior). It seizes drugs at<br/>the border, thereby reducing the supply, increasing the price, and presumably<br/>reducing demand (regulating the market to regulate behavior). And at times<br/>it has even (and grotesquely) regulated the “code” of drugs (by, for example,<br/>spraying marijuana fields with paraquat), making them more dangerous and<br/>thereby increasing the constraint on their consumption.48 All of these together<br/>influence the consumption of drugs. But as advocates of legalization argue,<br/>

132<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
they also influence the incidence of other criminal behavior as well. The pol-<br/>icy maker must assess the net effect—whether on the whole these regulations<br/>reduce or increase social costs.<br/>
<i>Abortion</i>: One final example will complete the account. Since <i>Roe v.</i><br/>
<i>Wade, </i>the Court has recognized a woman’s constitutional right to an abor-<br/>tion.49 This right, however, has not stopped government from seeking to<br/>eliminate or reduce the number of abortions. Again, the government need<br/>not rely on direct regulation of abortion (which under Roe would be uncon-<br/>stitutional). It can instead use indirect means to the same end. In <i>Rust v.<br/>Sullivan, </i>the Court upheld the power of the government to bias the provision<br/>of family planning advice by forbidding doctors in “government-funded”<br/>clinics from mentioning abortion as a method of family planning.50 This is<br/>a regulation of social norms (within the social structure of medical care) to<br/>regulate behavior. In <i>Maher v. Roe, </i>the Court upheld the right of the govern-<br/>ment to disable selectively medical funding for abortion.51 This is the use of<br/>the market to regulate behavior. And in <i>Hodgson v. Minnesota, </i>the Court<br/>upheld the right of the state to force minor women to wait forty-eight hours<br/>before getting an abortion.52 This is the use of real-space code (the con-<br/>straints of time) to regulate access to abortion. In all these ways, <i>Roe </i>notwith-<br/>standing, the government can regulate the behavior of women wanting<br/>abortions.<br/>
In each of these examples, law functions in two very different ways.53<br/>
When its operation is direct, it tells individuals how to behave and threatens<br/>punishment if they deviate from that behavior. When its operation is indirect,<br/>it modifies one of the other structures of constraint.54 The regulator selects<br/>from among these various techniques according to the return from each—<br/>both in efficiency and in the values that each might express.<br/>
When we see regulation in this more general way, we can see more clearly<br/>
how the unregulability of cyberspace is contingent. We get a stronger sense of<br/>how the state could intervene to make regulation work, and we should also get<br/>a sense of the increased dangers presented by this more expansive sense of reg-<br/>ulation. In particular, we should have a stronger sense of the danger it presents<br/>to constitutional values. The next section considers one such threat.<br/>
THE PROBLEMS OF INDIRECTION<br/>
In 1985, after years of inaction, Congress passed the Low Level Radioactive<br/>Waste Policy Amendments Act to deal with the problem of nuclear waste.<br/>Someone needed to take and store nuclear waste.55 After sufficient prodding<br/>by the government, a number of states formed a compact, which Congress<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
133<br/>
then ratified, implementing a number of requirements and incentives for<br/>states to deal with the nuclear waste they produce.<br/>
The details of the overall plan are not important here. It is enough to<br/>
focus on just one part. To induce states to follow federal guidelines for regu-<br/>lating nuclear waste, Congress gave them a choice: Either enact certain regu-<br/>lations or “take title” to the spent nuclear fuel. This was a “your money or your<br/>life” regulation, for the fuel to which the states would take title was not an<br/>asset but a great liability. In a very heavy-handed way, Congress was essentially<br/>forcing states to pass the regulations it wanted.<br/>
The Supreme Court struck down this part of the law. In effect, the Court<br/>
held, Congress was commandeering the state legislatures to enact Congress’s<br/>law. Congress itself, of course, had the power to enact those regulations<br/>directly. But it did not have the power to order states to enact laws. Indirection<br/>here was not allowed.<br/>
This case—<i>New York v. United States</i>—does not stand for the broad prin-<br/>
ciple that government must regulate only directly, or even for the principle<br/>that indirect regulation generally is disfavored. The case was focused quite<br/>narrowly on the question of indirection as it involved the states. The most<br/><i>New York </i>stands for is the idea that states, as independent sovereigns deserving<br/>of special constitutional respect, cannot be co-opted to the federal govern-<br/>ment’s ends—that when the federal government has a program it wants to<br/>carry out, it must put its own name behind it.<br/>
But while <i>New York </i>doesn’t establish a general constitutional principle, it<br/>
does suggest why indirection should be a more general concern.<br/>
Indirection misdirects responsibility. When a government uses other<br/>
structures of constraint to effect a constraint it could impose directly, it mud-<br/>dies the responsibility for that constraint and so undermines political<br/>accountability. If transparency is a value in constitutional government, indi-<br/>rection is its enemy. It confuses responsibility and hence confuses politics.56<br/>
Such misunderstandings are possible in other contexts as well. Think<br/>
again about the case of <i>Rust. </i>The federal government helps to fund family<br/>planning clinics. (“Helps” fund, not completely funds.)57 Before 1988 these<br/>clinics gave advice on a wide range of birth-related topics, including abortion.<br/>Doctors in family planning clinics would advise their patients about abortion<br/>whenever they felt such advice was proper.<br/>
The Reagan administration wanted to change that, so it ordered (the<br/>
details of how are not important here) doctors in those clinics to not discuss<br/>abortion as a method of family planning with their patients. If asked, the<br/>doctors were to say, “The project does not consider abortion an appropriate<br/>method of family planning.”58<br/>

134<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
The aim of this regulation was clear: to reduce the incidence of abortion.<br/>
It did this by using doctors to steer patients away from abortion. A doctor has<br/>a great deal of power over a patient in a context like this, and the patient<br/>would most likely believe the doctor was recommending against abortion.<br/>
But notice the technique. The federal government could have stated its<br/>
own position about abortion. It could have put up posters and billboards<br/>saying that abortion is wrong, or it could have used space in its clinics to<br/>advertise its view. But it chose instead to bury its policy choice in the words of<br/>doctors. It thereby could trade on the professional authority of the doctors to<br/>advance its own ends. It could regulate abortion indirectly by regulating the<br/>doctors directly.<br/>
Just as it tried to use the authority of the states to effect its ends in <i>New</i><br/>
<i>York, </i>the government trades on a misrepresentation in <i>Rust. </i>But worse than<br/>in the federalism context, the victim of the misrepresentation here does not<br/>even realize that the misrepresentation is a policy choice. The patient is<br/>unlikely to hear the doctor’s statement as a political broadcast from the gov-<br/>ernment; she is most likely to hear it as a medical opinion. Not only is there<br/>a confusion about who is responsible for the opinion expressed, but there is<br/>also confusion about whether it is an opinion at all.<br/>
<i>Rust v. Sullivan </i>is one of the great embarrassments of the Supreme<br/>
Court—the case proving Justice Scalia’s rule that any issue gets distorted once<br/>it gets near the question of abortion.59 But my argument here doesn’t depend<br/>upon whether <i>Rust </i>was right. My aim is to bring out a certain sensibility<br/>about regulation; <i>Rust </i>simply points the way.<br/>
Consider a third case. Until 1948 deeds could include covenants<br/>
(promises) that the property covered by the deed could not be sold to people<br/>of a particular race. The purpose of these provisions was clear: to effect and<br/>preserve segregation. Their use was extensive. It was estimated, for example,<br/>that when <i>Shelley v Kraemer</i>60 struck these provisions down as unconstitu-<br/>tional under the equal protection clause, 25 percent of the properties in south<br/>Chicago had been prohibited from sale to African Americans.61<br/>
As awful as such provisions were, they had a certain integrity. They clearly<br/>
stated their purpose and were transparent about the values they affirmed. No<br/>one could pretend that the segregation they effected was somehow an acci-<br/>dental by-product of decisions made elsewhere. Although they were private<br/>covenants, they were enforced by the state and, indeed, derived their meaning<br/>from the state. They said: This society is racist.<br/>
When the Court struck these provisions down, however, the question<br/>
became what would replace them. Few expected that the attitudes behind these<br/>covenants would suddenly disappear because of a single court judgment. So<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
135<br/>
when the Court ended direct segregation, we should expect indirect segrega-<br/>tion to emerge to replace it.<br/>
Sure enough, after 1948 local communities shifted their technique for<br/>
preserving segregation. Rather than covenants, they used architecture. Com-<br/>munities were designed to “break the flow” of residents from one to another.<br/>Highways without easy crossings were placed between communities. Railroad<br/>tracks were used to divide. A thousand tiny inconveniences of architecture<br/>and zoning replaced the express preferences of covenants. Nothing formally<br/>prohibited integration, but informally, much did. 62<br/>
Local governments thus did something very much like what the federal<br/>
government did in <i>Rust </i>and tried to do in <i>New York: </i>No longer able to effect<br/>segregation directly, they used zoning laws—geographical architecture, or real-<br/>space code—to effect it indirectly. They built their communities and designed<br/>their streets to make it hard for integration to occur, and the tiny inconven-<br/>iences of zoning regulations succeeded in keeping communities separate.<br/>
What is most significant is that now, even more than with <i>Rust, </i>it<br/>
becomes very difficult to see the link between the regulation and its conse-<br/>quence. The continuing segregation of these communities is described as the<br/>product of “choice.” Individuals choose to live in one neighborhood rather<br/>than another. In a strict sense, that is correct, but their choices are made in the<br/>face of costs that the state has imposed. It is easier to remain segregated, so<br/>people choose to do that. But it is only easier because government has moved<br/>mountains to make it that way.<br/>
Here the government is regulating indirectly by using the structures of<br/>
real-space code to effect its ends, but this regulation, again, is not seen as reg-<br/>ulation. Here the government gets an effect at no political cost. It gets the<br/>benefit of what would clearly be an illegal and controversial regulation with-<br/>out even having to admit any regulation exists.<br/>
In all three cases, the government is commandeering the power of<br/>
another modality—another structure of constraint—to effect its own ends.63<br/>This in itself is not necessarily improper. There are plenty of examples that<br/>anyone would consider proper. A requirement that streets be well lit, for<br/>instance, is a regulation designed to reduce crime, and no one would think<br/>that regulation improper. Nor does all such regulation hide its pedigree. Think<br/>again about speed bumps–they are examples of indirect regulation. Like a<br/>winding road, they use the code of streets to keep down the speed of a car. But<br/>no one is fooled about the source of this regulation; no one believes the<br/>bumps are accidental.<br/>
Thus, the point is not against indirect regulation generally. The point is<br/>
instead about transparency. The state has no right to hide its agenda. In a<br/>

136<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
constitutional democracy its regulations should be public. And thus, one issue<br/>raised by the practice of indirect regulation is the general issue of publicity.<br/>Should the state be permitted to use nontransparent means when transparent<br/>means are available?<br/>
WHERE THIS LEADS<br/>
After I published an essay in the (then existing) <i>Industry Standard </i>arguing that<br/>“code is law,”64 the following letter was sent to the editor:<br/>
Typical for a Harvard Law Professor. . . . Lessig misses the entire forest while dancing<br/>
among the trees. . . . While his riff on West Coast Code (from Silicon Valley Program-<br/>
mers) vs. East Coast Code (from government lawyers) is very cleverly crafted, it<br/>
completely avoids the real difference between the two.<br/>
The good professor seems to apply the word “regulation” equally to the efforts<br/>
of private enterprises to control the behavior of their customers through market<br/>
mechanisms and the efforts of government agencies to control the behavior of all cit-<br/>
izens through force of law.<br/>
So long as the creators and purveyors of West Coast Code (no matter how self-<br/>
ish, monopolistic, demonic or incompetent they may be) do not carry guns and<br/>
badges, I will choose them over the enforcers of East Coast Code any time.65<br/>
Whether or not I’ve missed the “real difference” between code and law, the<br/>
genius in this letter is that its author clearly sees the real similarity. The author<br/>(the president of an Internet-related business) understands that “private<br/>enterprises” try to “control the behavior of their customers,” and he writes that<br/>they use “market mechanisms” to achieve that control. (Technically, I was<br/>speaking about architectures to achieve that effect, but never mind. Whether<br/>markets or architectures, the point is the same.) He therefore sees that there<br/>is “regulation” beyond law. He just has his favorite between the two (corporate<br/>executive that he is).<br/>
What this author sees is what we all must see to understand how cyber-<br/>
space is regulated and to see how law might regulate cyberspace. I’ve argued<br/>in this chapter that government has a range of tools that it uses to regulate,<br/>and cyberspace expands that range. Indirectly, by regulating code writing, the<br/>government can achieve regulatory ends, often without suffering the political<br/>consequences that the same ends, pursued directly, would yield.<br/>
We should worry about this. We should worry about a regime that makes<br/>
invisible regulation easier; we should worry about a regime that makes it eas-<br/>ier to regulate. We should worry about the first because invisibility makes it<br/>

what things regulate<br/>
137<br/>
hard to resist bad regulation; we should worry about the second because we<br/>don’t yet—as I argue in Part III—have a sense of the values put at risk by the<br/>increasing scope of efficient regulation.<br/>
That’s a lot of worries, no doubt. But before we go further with these<br/>
worries, we could consider in more detail the contexts within which these<br/>worries become real.<br/>

I’VE TOLD A STORY ABOUT HOW REGULATION WORKS, AND ABOUT THE INCREASING<br/>regulability of the Internet that we should expect. These are, as I described,<br/>changes in the architecture of the Net that will better enable government’s<br/>control by making behavior more easily monitored—or at least more trace-<br/>able. These changes will emerge even if government does nothing. They are<br/>the by-product of changes made to enable e-commerce. But they will be<br/>cemented if (or when) the government recognizes just how it could make<br/>the network its tool.<br/>
That was Part I. In this part, I’ve focused upon a different regulabil-<br/>
ity—the kind of regulation that is effected through the architectures of the<br/>space within which one lives. As I argued in Chapter 5, there’s nothing new<br/>about this modality of regulation: Governments have used architecture to<br/>regulate behavior forever. But what is new is its significance. As life moves<br/>onto the Net, more of life will be regulated through the self-conscious<br/>design of the space within which life happens. That’s not necessarily a bad<br/>thing. If there were a code-based way to stop drunk drivers, I’d be all for it.<br/>But neither is this pervasive code-based regulation benign. Due to the man-<br/>ner in which it functions, regulation by code can interfere with the ordinary<br/>democratic process by which we hold regulators accountable.<br/>
The key criticism that I’ve identified so far is transparency. Code-based<br/>
regulation—especially of people who are not themselves technically<br/>expert—risks making regulation invisible. Controls are imposed for partic-<br/>ular policy reasons, but people experience these controls as nature. And<br/>that experience, I suggested, could weaken democratic resolve.<br/>
Now that’s not saying much, at least about us. We are already a pretty<br/>
apathetic political culture. And there’s nothing about cyberspace to suggest<br/>
138<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
139<br/>
things are going to be different. Indeed, as Castranova observes about vir-<br/>tual worlds: “How strange, then, that one does not find much democracy at<br/>all in synthetic worlds. Not a trace, in fact. Not a hint of a shadow of a trace.<br/>It’s not there. The typical governance model in synthetic worlds consists of<br/>isolated moments of oppressive tyranny embedded in widespread anar-<br/>chy.”1<br/>
But if we could put aside our own skepticism about our democracy for<br/>
a moment, and focus at least upon aspects of the Internet and cyberspace<br/>that we all agree matter fundamentally, then I think we will all recognize a<br/>point that, once recognized, seems obvious: If code regulates, then in at<br/>least some critical contexts, the kind of code that regulates is critically<br/>important.<br/>
By “kind” I mean to distinguish between two types of code: open and<br/>
closed. By “open code” I mean code (both software and hardware) whose<br/>functionality is transparent at least to one knowledgeable about the technol-<br/>ogy. By “closed code,” I mean code (both software and hardware) whose<br/>functionality is opaque. One can guess what closed code is doing; and with<br/>enough opportunity to test, one might well reverse engineer it. But from the<br/>technology itself, there is no reasonable way to discern what the functional-<br/>ity of the technology is.<br/>
The terms “open” and “closed” code will suggest to many a critically<br/>
important debate about how software should be developed. What most call<br/>the “open source software movement,” but which I, following Richard Stall-<br/>man, call the “free software movement,” argues (in my view at least) that<br/>there are fundamental values of freedom that demand that software be<br/>developed as free software. The opposite of free software, in this sense, is<br/>proprietary software, where the developer hides the functionality of the<br/>software by distributing digital objects that are opaque about the underlying<br/>design.<br/>
I will describe this debate more in the balance of this chapter. But<br/>
importantly, the point I am making about “open” versus “closed” code is dis-<br/>tinct from the point about how code gets created. I personally have very<br/>strong views about how code should be created. But whatever side you are<br/>on in the “free vs. proprietary software” debate in general, in at least the con-<br/>texts I will identify here, you should be able to agree with me first, that<br/>open code is a constraint on state power, and second, that in at least some<br/>cases, code must, in the relevant sense, be “open.”<br/>
To set the stage for this argument, I want to describe two contexts in<br/>
which I will argue that we all should agree that the kind of code deployed<br/>matters. The balance of the chapter then makes that argument.<br/>

140<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
BYTES THAT SNIFF<br/>
In Chapter 2, I described technology that at the time was a bit of science fic-<br/>tion. In the five years since, that fiction has become even less fictional. In<br/>1997, the government announced a project called Carnivore. Carnivore was to<br/>be a technology that sifted through e-mail traffic and collected just those e-<br/>mails written by or to a particular and named individual. The FBI intended to<br/>use this technology, pursuant to court orders, to gather evidence while inves-<br/>tigating crimes.<br/>
In principle, there’s lots to praise in the ideals of the Carnivore design.<br/>
The protocols required a judge to approve this surveillance. The technology<br/>was intended to collect data only about the target of the investigation. No<br/>one else was to be burdened by the tool. No one else was to have their privacy<br/>compromised.<br/>
But whether the technology did what it was said to do depends upon its<br/>
code. And that code was closed.2 The contract the government let with the<br/>vendor that developed the Carnivore software did not require that the source<br/>for the software be made public. It instead permitted the vendor to keep the<br/>code secret.<br/>
Now it’s easy to understand why the vendor wanted its code kept secret.<br/>
In general, inviting others to look at your code is much like inviting them to<br/>your house for dinner: There’s lots you need to do to make the place present-<br/>able. In this case in particular, the DOJ may have been concerned about secu-<br/>rity.3 But substantively, however, the vendor might want to use components of<br/>the software in other software projects. If the code is public, the vendor might<br/>lose some advantage from that transparency. These advantages for the vendor<br/>mean that it would be more costly for the government to insist upon a tech-<br/>nology that was delivered with its source code revealed. And so the question<br/>should be whether there’s something the government gains from having the<br/>source code revealed.<br/>
And here’s the obvious point: As the government quickly learned as it<br/>
tried to sell the idea of Carnivore, the fact that its code was secret was costly.<br/>Much of the government’s efforts were devoted to trying to build trust around<br/>its claim that Carnivore did just what it said it did. But the argument “I’m<br/>from the government, so trust me” doesn’t have much weight. And thus, the<br/>efforts of the government to deploy this technology—again, a valuable tech-<br/>nology if it did what it said it did—were hampered.<br/>
I don’t know of any study that tries to evaluate the cost the government<br/>
faced because of the skepticism about Carnivore versus the cost of developing<br/>Carnivore in an open way.4 I would be surprised if the government’s strategy<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
141<br/>
made fiscal sense. But whether or not it was cheaper to develop closed rather<br/>than open code, it shouldn’t be controversial that the government has an<br/>independent obligation to make its procedures—at least in the context of<br/>ordinary criminal prosecution—transparent. I don’t mean that the investiga-<br/>tor needs to reveal the things he thinks about when deciding which suspects<br/>to target. I mean instead the procedures for invading the privacy interests of<br/>ordinary citizens.<br/>
The only kind of code that can do that is “open code.” And the small<br/>
point I want to insist upon just now is that where transparency of government<br/>action matters, so too should the kind of code it uses. This is not the claim<br/>that all government code should be public. I believe there are legitimate areas<br/>within which the government can act secretly. More particularly, where trans-<br/>parency would interfere with the function itself, then there’s a good argument<br/>against transparency. But there were very limited ways in which a possible<br/>criminal suspect could more effectively evade the surveillance of Carnivore<br/>just because its code was open. And thus, again, open code should, in my<br/>view, have been the norm.<br/>
MACHINES THAT COUNT<br/>
Before November 7, 2000, there was very little discussion among national<br/>policy makers about the technology of voting machines. For most (and I was<br/>within this majority), the question of voting technology seemed trivial. Cer-<br/>tainly, there could have been faster technologies for tallying a vote. And there<br/>could have been better technologies to check for errors. But the idea that any-<br/>thing important hung upon these details in technology was not an idea that<br/>made the cover of the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>.<br/>
The 2000 presidential election changed all that. More specifically, Florida<br/>
in 2000 changed all that. Not only did the Florida experience demonstrate the<br/>imperfection in traditional mechanical devices for tabulating votes (exhibit 1,<br/>the hanging chad), it also demonstrated the extraordinary inequality that<br/>having different technologies in different parts of the state would produce. As<br/>Justice Stevens described in his dissent in <i>Bush v. Gore, </i>almost 4 percent of<br/>punch-card ballots were disqualified, while only 1.43 percent of optical scan<br/>ballots were disqualified.5 And as one study estimated, changing a single vote<br/>on each machine would have changed the outcome of the election.6<br/>
The 2004 election made things even worse. In the four years since the<br/>
Florida debacle, a few companies had pushed to deploy new electronic voting<br/>machines. But these voting machines seemed to create more anxiety among<br/>voters than less. While most voters are not techies, everyone has a sense of the<br/>

142<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
obvious queasiness that a totally electronic voting machine produces. You<br/>stand before a terminal and press buttons to indicate your vote. The machine<br/>confirms your vote and then reports the vote has been recorded. But how do<br/>you know? How could anyone know? And even if you’re not conspiracy-<br/>theory-oriented enough to believe that every voting machine is fixed, how can<br/>anyone know that when these voting machines check in with the central<br/>server, the server records their votes accurately? What’s to guarantee that the<br/>numbers won’t be fudged?<br/>
The most extreme example of this anxiety was produced by the leading<br/>
electronic voting company, Diebold. In 2003, Diebold had been caught fudg-<br/>ing the numbers associated with tests of its voting technology. Memos leaked<br/>to the public showed that Diebold’s management knew the machines were<br/>flawed and intentionally chose to hide that fact. (The company then sued<br/>students who had published these memos—for copyright infringement. The<br/>students won a countersuit against Diebold.)<br/>
That incident seemed only to harden Diebold in its ways. The company<br/>
continued to refuse to reveal anything about the code that its machines ran.<br/>It refused to bid in contexts in which such transparency was required. And<br/>when you tie that refusal to its chairman’s promise to “deliver Ohio” for Pres-<br/>ident Bush in 2004, you have all the makings of a perfect trust storm. You con-<br/>trol the machines; you won’t show us how they work; and you promise a<br/>particular result in the election. Is there any doubt people would be suspi-<br/>cious?7<br/>
Now it turns out that it is a very hard question to know how electronic<br/>
voting machines should be designed. In one of my own dumbest moments<br/>since turning 21, I told a colleague that there was no reason to have a confer-<br/>ence about electronic voting since all the issues were “perfectly obvious.”<br/>They’re not perfectly obvious. In fact, they’re very difficult. It seems obvious<br/>to some that, like an ATM, there should at least be a printed receipt. But if<br/>there’s a printed receipt, that would make it simple for voters to sell their<br/>votes. Moreover, there’s no reason the receipt needs to reflect what was<br/>counted. Nor does the receipt necessarily reflect what was transmitted to any<br/>central tabulating authority. The question of how best to design these systems<br/>turns out not to be obvious. And having uttered absolute garbage about this<br/>point before, I won’t enter here into any consideration of how best this might<br/>be architected.<br/>
But however a system is architected, there is an independent point about<br/>
the openness of the code that comprises the system. Again, the procedures<br/>used to tabulate votes must be transparent. In the nondigital world, those<br/>procedures were obvious. In the digital world, however they’re architected, we<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
143<br/>
need a way to ensure that the machine does what it is said it will do. One sim-<br/>ple way to do that is either to open the code to those machines, or, at a mini-<br/>mum, require that that code be certified by independent inspectors. Many<br/>would prefer the latter to the former, just because transparency here might<br/>increase the chances of the code being hacked. My own intuition about that<br/>is different. But whether or not the code is completely open, requirements for<br/>certification are obvious. And for certification to function, the code for the<br/>technology must—in a limited sense at least—be open.<br/>{TXB2}<br/>Both of these examples make a similar point. But that point, however, is not<br/>universal. There are times when code needs to be transparent, even if there are<br/>times when it does not. I’m not talking about all code for whatever purposes.<br/>I don’t think Wal*Mart needs to reveal the code for calculating change at its<br/>check-out counters. I don’t even think Yahoo! should have to reveal the code<br/>for its Instant Messaging service. But I do think we all should think that, in<br/>certain contexts at least, the transparency of open code should be a require-<br/>ment.<br/>
This is a point that Phil Zimmermann taught by his practice more than<br/>
15 years ago. Zimmermann wrote and released to the Net a program called<br/>PGP (pretty good privacy). PGP provides cryptographic privacy and authen-<br/>tication. But Zimmermann recognized that it would not earn trust enough to<br/>provide these services well unless he made available the source code to the<br/>program. So from the beginning (except for a brief lapse when the program<br/>was owned by a company called NAI8) the source code has been available for<br/>anyone to review and verify. That publicity has built confidence in the code—<br/>a confidence that could never have been produced by mere command. In this<br/>case, open code served the purpose of the programmer, as his purpose was to<br/>build confidence and trust in a system that would support privacy and<br/>authentication. Open code worked.<br/>
The hard question is whether there’s any claim to be made beyond this<br/>
minimal one. That’s the question for the balance of this chapter: How does<br/>open code affect regulability?<br/>
CODE ON THE NET<br/>
I’ve spent lots of time talking about “code.” It’s time to be a bit more specific<br/>about what “code” in the context of the Internet is, in what sense should we<br/>consider this code to be “open,” and in what contexts its openness will matter.<br/>
As I’ve mentioned, the Internet is constructed by a set of protocols<br/>
together referred to as TCP/IP. The TCP/IP suite includes a large number of<br/>

144<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
protocols that feed different “layers” of the network. The standard model for<br/>describing layers of a network is the open systems interconnect (OSI) refer-<br/>ence model. It describes seven network layers, each representing a “function<br/>performed when data is transferred between cooperating applications across”<br/>the network. But the TCP/IP suite is not as well articulated in that model.<br/>According to Craig Hunt, “most descriptions of TCP/IP define three to five<br/>functional levels in the protocol architecture.” In my view, it is simplest to<br/>describe four functional layers in a TCP/IP architecture.9 From the bottom of<br/>the stack up, we can call these the data link, network, transport, and applica-<br/>tion layers.10<br/>
Three layers constitute the essential plumbing of the Internet, hidden in<br/>
the Net’s walls. (The faucets work at the next layer; be patient.) At the very<br/>bottom, just above the physical layer of the Internet, in the data link layer, very<br/>few protocols operate, since that handles local network interactions exclu-<br/>sively. More protocols exist at the next layer up, the network layer, where the<br/>IP protocol is dominant. It routes data between hosts and across network<br/>links, determining which path the data should take. At the next layer up, the<br/>transport layer, two different protocols dominate—TCP and UDP. These<br/>negotiate the flow of data between two network hosts. (The difference<br/>between the two is reliability—UDP offers no reliability guarantee.)<br/>
The protocols together function as a kind of odd UPS. Data are passed<br/>
from the application to the transport layer. There the data are placed in a<br/>(virtual) box and a (virtual) label is slapped on. That label ties the contents of<br/>the box to particular processes. (This is the work of the TCP or UDP proto-<br/>cols.) That box is then passed to the network layer, where the IP protocol<br/>puts the package into another package, with its own label. This label includes<br/>the origination and destination addresses. That box then can be further<br/>wrapped at the data link layer, depending on the specifics of the local network<br/>(whether, for example, it is an Ethernet network).<br/>
The whole process is thus a bizarre packaging game: A new box is added<br/>
at each layer, and a new label on each box describes the process at that layer.<br/>At the other end, the packaging process is reversed: Like a Russian doll, each<br/>package is opened at the proper layer, until at the end the machine recovers<br/>the initial application data.<br/>
On top of these three layers is the application layer of the Internet. Here<br/>
protocols “proliferate.”11 These include the most familiar network application<br/>protocols, such as FTP (file transfer protocol, a protocol for transferring files),<br/>SMTP (simple mail transport protocol, a protocol for transferring mail), and<br/>HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol, a protocol to publish and read hypertext<br/>documents across the Web). These are rules for how a client (your computer)<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
145<br/>
will interact with a server (where the data are), or with another computer (in<br/>peer-to-peer services), and the other way around.12<br/>
These four layers of protocols are “the Internet.” Building on simple<br/>
blocks, the system makes possible an extraordinary range of interaction. It is<br/>perhaps not quite as amazing as nature—think of DNA—but it is built on the<br/>same principle: keep the elements simple, and the compounds will astound.<br/>
When I speak about regulating the code, I’m not talking about changing<br/>
these core TCP/IP protocols. (Though in principle, of course, they could be<br/>regulated, and others have suggested that they should be.)13 In my view these<br/>components of the network are fixed. If you required them to be different,<br/>you’d break the Internet. Thus rather than imagining the government chang-<br/>ing the core, the question I want to consider is how the government might<br/>either (1) complement the core with technology that adds regulability, or (2)<br/>regulates applications that connect to the core. Both will be important, but my<br/>focus is on the code that plugs into the Internet. I will call that code the “appli-<br/>cation space” of the Internet. This includes all the code that implements<br/>TCP/IP protocols at the application layer—browsers, operating systems,<br/>encryption modules, Java, e-mail systems, P2P, whatever elements you want.<br/>The question for the balance of this chapter is: What is the character of that<br/>code that makes it susceptible to regulation?<br/>
A SHORT HISTORY OF CODE ON THE NET<br/>
In the beginning, of course, there were very few applications on the Net. The<br/>Net was no more than a protocol for exchanging data, and the original pro-<br/>grams simply took advantage of this protocol. The file transfer protocol (FTP)<br/>was born early in the Net’s history;14 the electronic message protocol (SMTP)<br/>was born soon after. It was not long before a protocol to display directories in<br/>a graphical way (Gopher) was developed. And in 1991 the most famous of<br/>protocols—the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) and hyper text markup<br/>language (HTML)—gave birth to the World Wide Web.<br/>
Each protocol spawned many applications. Since no one had a monopoly<br/>
on the protocol, no one had a monopoly on its implementation. There were<br/>many FTP applications and many e-mail servers. There were even a large<br/>number of browsers.15 The protocols were open standards, gaining their bless-<br/>ing from standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)<br/>and, later, the W3C. Once a protocol was specified, programmers could build<br/>programs that utilized it.<br/>
Much of the software implementing these protocols was “open,” at least<br/>
initially—that is, the source code for the software was available along with the<br/>

146<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
object code.16 This openness was responsible for much of the early Net’s<br/>growth. Others could explore how a program was implemented and learn<br/>from that example how better to implement the protocol in the future.<br/>
The World Wide Web is the best example of this point. Again, the code<br/>
that makes a web page appear as it does is called the hyper text markup lan-<br/>guage, or HTML.17 With HTML, you can specify how a web page will appear<br/>and to what it will be linked.<br/>
The original HTML was proposed in 1990 by the CERN researchers Tim<br/>
Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau.18 It was designed to make it easy to link<br/>documents at a research facility, but it quickly became obvious that docu-<br/>ments on any machine on the Internet could be linked. Berners-Lee and Cail-<br/>liau made both HTML and its companion HTTP freely available for anyone<br/>to take.<br/>
And take them people did, at first slowly, but then at an extraordinary<br/>
rate. People started building web pages and linking them to others. HTML<br/>became one of the fastest-growing computer languages in the history of com-<br/>puting.<br/>
Why? One important reason was that HTML was always “open.” Even<br/>
today, on most browsers in distribution, you can always reveal the “source” of<br/>a web page and see what makes it tick. The source remains open: You can<br/>download it, copy it, and improve it as you wish. Copyright law may protect<br/>the source code of a web page, but in reality it protects it very imperfectly.<br/>HTML became as popular as it did primarily because it was so easy to copy.<br/>Anyone, at any time, could look under the hood of an HTML document and<br/>learn how the author produced it.<br/>
Openness—not property or contract but free code and access—created<br/>
the boom that gave birth to the Internet that we now know. And it was this<br/>boom that then attracted the attention of commerce. With all this activity,<br/>commerce rightly reasoned, surely there was money to be made.<br/>
Historically the commercial model for producing software has been dif-<br/>
ferent.19 Though the history began even as the open code movement contin-<br/>ued, commercial software vendors were not about to produce “free” (what<br/>most call “open source”) software. Commercial vendors produced software<br/>that was closed—that traveled without its source and was protected against<br/>modification both by the law and by its own code.<br/>
By the second half of the 1990s—marked most famously by Microsoft’s<br/>
Windows 95, which came bundled Internet-savvy—commercial software ven-<br/>dors began producing “application space” code. This code was increasingly<br/>connected to the Net—it increasingly became code “on” the Internet. But for<br/>the most part, the code remained closed.<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
147<br/>
That began to change, however, around the turn of the century. Especially<br/>
in the context of peer-to-peer services, technologies emerged that were dom-<br/>inant and “open.” More importantly, the protocols these technologies<br/>depended upon were unregulated. Thus, for example, the protocol that the<br/>peer-to-peer client Grokster used to share content on the Internet is itself an<br/>open standard that anyone can use. Many commercial entities tried to use that<br/>standard, at least until the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Grokster</i>. But even if<br/>that decision inspires every commercial entity to abandon the StreamCast<br/>network, noncommercial implementations of the protocol will still exist.<br/>
The same mix between open and closed exists in both browsers and blog-<br/>
ging software. Firefox is the more popular current implementation of the<br/>Mozilla technology—the technology that originally drove the Netscape<br/>browser. It competes with Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and a handful of<br/>other commercial browsers. Likewise, WordPress is an open-source blogging<br/>tool that competes with a handful of other proprietary blogging tools.<br/>
This recent growth in open code builds upon a long tradition. Part of<br/>
the motivation for that tradition is ideological, or values based. Richard Stall-<br/>man is the inspiration here. In 1984, Stallman began the Free Software Foun-<br/>dation with the aim of fueling the growth of free software. A MacArthur<br/>Fellow who gave up his career to commit himself to the cause, Stallman has<br/>devoted the last twenty years of his life to free software. That work began<br/>with the GNU project, which sought to develop a free operating system. By<br/>1991, the GNU project had just about everything it needed, except a kernel.<br/>That final challenge was taken up by an undergraduate at the University of<br/>Helsinki. That year, Linus Torvalds posted on the Internet the kernel of an<br/>operating system. He invited the world to extend and experiment with it.<br/>
People took up the challenge, and slowly, through the early 1990s, marry-<br/>
ing the GNU project with Torvald’s kernel, they built an operating system—<br/>GNU/Linux. By 1998, it had become apparent to all that GNU/Linux was<br/>going to be an important competitor to the Microsoft operating system.<br/>Microsoft may have imagined in 1995 that by 2000 there would be no other<br/>server operating system available except Windows NT, but when 2000 came<br/>around, there was GNU/Linux, presenting a serious threat to Microsoft in<br/>the server market. Now in 2007, Linux-based web servers continue to gain<br/>market share at the expense of Microsoft systems.<br/>
GNU/Linux is amazing in many ways. It is amazing first because it is the-<br/>
oretically imperfect but practically superior. Linus Torvalds rejected what<br/>computer science told him was the ideal operating system design,20 and<br/>instead built an operating system that was designed for a single processor (an<br/>Intel 386) and not cross-platform-compatible. Its creative development, and<br/>

148<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
the energy it inspired, slowly turned GNU/Linux into an extraordinarily pow-<br/>erful system. As of this writing, GNU/Linux has been ported to at least eight-<br/>een different computer architecture platforms—from the original Intel<br/>processors, to Apple’s PowerPC chip, to Sun SPARC chips, and mobile devices<br/>using ARM processors.21 Creative hackers have even ported Linux to squeeze<br/>onto Apple’s iPod and old Atari systems. Although initially designed to speak<br/>only one language, GNU/Linux has become the lingua franca of free software<br/>operating systems.<br/>
What makes a system open is a commitment among its developers to<br/>
keep its core code public—to keep the hood of the car unlocked. That com-<br/>mitment is not just a wish; Stallman encoded it in a license that sets the terms<br/>that control the future use of most free software. This is the Free Software<br/>Foundation’s General Public License (GPL), which requires that any code<br/>licensed with GPL (as GNU/Linux is) keep its source free. GNU/Linux was<br/>developed by an extraordinary collection of hackers worldwide only because<br/>its code was open for others to work on.<br/>
Its code, in other words, sits in the commons.22 Anyone can take it and use<br/>
it as she wishes. Anyone can take it and come to understand how it works. The<br/>code of GNU/Linux is like a research program whose results are always pub-<br/>lished for others to see. Everything is public; anyone, without having to seek<br/>the permission of anyone else, may join the project.<br/>
This project has been wildly more successful than anyone ever imagined.<br/>
In 1992, most would have said that it was impossible to build a free operating<br/>system from volunteers around the world. In 2002, no one could doubt it<br/>anymore. But if the impossible could become possible, then no doubt it could<br/>become impossible again. And certain trends in computing technology may<br/>create precisely this threat.<br/>
For example, consider the way Active Server Pages (ASP) code works on<br/>
the network. When you go to an ASP page on the Internet, the server runs a<br/>program—a script to give you access to a database, for example, or a program<br/>to generate new data you need. ASPs are increasingly popular ways to provide<br/>program functionality. You use it all the time when you are on the Internet.<br/>
But the code that runs ASPs is not technically “distributed.” Thus, even if<br/>
the code is produced using GPL’d code, there’s no GPL obligation to release it<br/>to anyone. Therefore, as more and more of the infrastructure of networked<br/>life becomes governed by ASP, less and less will be effectively set free by free<br/>license.<br/>
“Trusted Computing” creates another threat to the open code ecology.<br/>
Launched as a response to virus and security threats within a networked envi-<br/>ronment, the key technical feature of “trusted computing” is that the platform<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
149<br/>
blocks programs that are not cryptographically signed or verified by the plat-<br/>form. For example, if you want to run a program on your computer, your<br/>computer would first verify that the program is certified by one of the author-<br/>ities recognized by the computer operating system, and “incorporat[ing]<br/>hardware and software . . . security standards approved by the content<br/>providers themselves.”23 If it isn’t, the program wouldn’t run.<br/>
In principle, of course, if the cost of certifying a program were tiny, this<br/>
limitation might be unproblematic. But the fear is that this restriction will<br/>operate to effectively block open code projects. It is not easy for a certifying<br/>authority to actually know what a program does; that means certifying<br/>authorities won’t be keen to certify programs they can’t trust. And that in<br/>turn will effect a significant discrimination against open code.<br/>
REGULATING OPEN CODE<br/>
Open code projects—whether free software or open source software projects—<br/>share the feature that the knowledge necessary to replicate the project is intended<br/>always to be available to others. There is no effort, through law or technology, for<br/>the developer of an open code project to make that development exclusive. And,<br/>more importantly, the capacity to replicate and redirect the evolution of a project<br/>provided in its most efficient form is also always preserved.<br/>
How does this fact affect the regulability of code?<br/>In Chapter 5, I sketched examples of government regulating code. But think<br/>
again about those examples: How does such regulation work?<br/>
Consider two. The government tells the telephone company something<br/>
about how its networks are to be designed, and the government tells television<br/>manufacturers what kinds of chips TVs are to have. Why do these regulations<br/>work?<br/>
The answer in each case is obvious. The code is regulable only because the<br/>
code writers can be controlled. If the state tells the phone company to do some-<br/>thing, the phone company is not likely to resist. Resistance would bring punish-<br/>ment; punishment is expensive; phone companies, like all other companies, want<br/>to reduce the cost of doing business. If the state’s regulation is rational (that is,<br/>effective), it will set the cost of disobeying the state above any possible benefit. If<br/>the target of regulation is a rational actor within the reach of the state, then the<br/>regulation is likely to have its intended effect. CALEA’s regulation of the network<br/>architecture for telephones is an obvious example of this (see Chapter 5).<br/>
An unmovable, and unmoving, target of regulation, then, is a good start<br/>
toward regulability. And this statement has an interesting corollary: Regulable<br/>code is closed code. Think again about telephone networks. When the govern-<br/>

150<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
ment induces the telephone networks to modify their network software, users<br/>have no choice about whether to adopt this modification or not. You pick up the<br/>phone, you get the dial tone the phone company gives you. No one I know hacks<br/>the telephone company’s code to build a different network design. The same<br/>with the V-chip—I doubt that many people would risk destroying their television<br/>by pulling out the chip, and I am certain that no one re-burns the chip to build<br/>in a different filtering technology.<br/>
In both cases the government’s regulation works because when the target of<br/>
the regulation complies, customers can do little but accept it.<br/>
Open code is different. We can see something of the difference in a story told<br/>
by Netscape’s former legal counsel, Peter Harter, about Netscape and the<br/>French.24<br/>
In 1996, Netscape released a protocol (SSL v3.0) to facilitate secure electronic<br/>
commerce on the Web. The essence of its function is to permit secure exchange<br/>between a browser and a server. The French were not happy with the security that<br/>SSL gave; they wanted to be able to crack SSL transactions. So they requested that<br/>Netscape modify SSL to enable their spying.<br/>
There are plenty of constraints on Netscape’s ability to modify SSL—not the<br/>
least of which being that Netscape has given SSL over to the public, in the form<br/>of a public standard. But assume for a second that it had not. Assume Netscape<br/>really did control the standards for SSL and in theory could modify the code to<br/>enable French spying. Would that mean that Netscape could comply with the<br/>French demand?<br/>
No. Technically, it could comply by modifying the code of Netscape Com-<br/>
municator and then posting a new module that enabled hacking by a govern-<br/>ment. But because Netscape (or more generally, the Mozilla project) is open<br/>source, anyone is free to build a competing module that would replace the<br/>Frenchified SSL module. That module would compete with other modules. The<br/>module that wins would be the one users wanted. Users don’t typically want a<br/>module that enables spying by a government.<br/>
The point is simple, but its implication is profound. To the extent that code<br/>
is open code, the power of government is constrained. Government can demand,<br/>government can threaten, but when the target of its regulation is plastic, it cannot<br/>rely on its target remaining as it wants.<br/>
Say you are a Soviet propagandist, and you want to get people to read lots of<br/>
information about Papa Stalin. So you declare that every book published in the<br/>Soviet Union must have a chapter devoted to Stalin. How likely is it that such<br/>books will actually affect what people read?<br/>
Books are open code: They hide nothing; they reveal their source—they are<br/>
their source! A user or adopter of a book always has the choice to read only the<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
151<br/>
chapters she wants. If it is a book on electronics, then the reader can certainly<br/>choose not to read the chapter on Stalin. There is very little the state can do to<br/>modify the reader’s power in this respect.<br/>
The same idea liberates open code. The government’s rules are rules only to<br/>
the extent that they impose restrictions that adopters would want. The govern-<br/>ment may coordinate standards (like “drive on the right”), but it certainly cannot<br/>impose standards that constrain users in ways they do not want to be con-<br/>strained. This architecture, then, is an important check on the government’s reg-<br/>ulatory power. Open code means open control—there is control, but the user is<br/>aware of it.25<br/>
Closed code functions differently. With closed code, users cannot easily<br/>
modify the control that the code comes packaged with. Hackers and very sophis-<br/>ticated programmers may be able to do so, but most users would not know<br/>which parts were required and which parts were not. Or more precisely, users<br/>would not be able to see the parts required and the parts not required because the<br/>source code does not come bundled with closed code. Closed code is the propa-<br/>gandist’s best strategy—not a separate chapter that the user can ignore, but a per-<br/>sistent and unrecognized influence that tilts the story in the direction the<br/>propagandist wants.<br/>
So far I’ve played fast and loose with the idea of a “user.” While some “users”<br/>
of Firefox could change its code if they didn’t like the way it functioned, the vast<br/>majority could not. For most of us, it is just as feasible to change the way<br/>Microsoft Word functions as it is to change the way GNU/Linux operates.<br/>
But the difference here is that there is—and legally can be—a community of<br/>
developers who modify open code, but there is not—or legally cannot be—a<br/>community of developers who modify closed code, at least without the owner’s<br/>permission. That culture of developers is the critical mechanism that creates the<br/>independence within open code. Without that culture, there’d be little real differ-<br/>ence between the regulability of open and closed code.<br/>
This in turn implies a different sort of limit on this limit on the regulability<br/>
of code. Communities of developers are likely to enable some types of deviations<br/>from rules imposed by governments. For example, they’re quite likely to resist the<br/>kind of regulation by the French to enable the cracking of financial safety. They’re<br/>less likely to disable virus protection or spam filters.<br/>
WHERE THIS LEADS<br/>
My argument so far has taken a simple path. In answer to those who say that<br/>the Net cannot be regulated, I’ve argued that whether it can be regulated<br/>depends on its architecture. Some architectures would be regulable, others<br/>

152<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
would not. I have then argued that government could take a role in deciding<br/>whether an architecture would be regulable or not. The government could<br/>take steps to transform an architecture from unregulable to regulable, both<br/>indirectly (by making behavior more traceable) and directly (by using code to<br/>directly effect the control the government wants).<br/>
The final step in this progression of regulability is a constraint that is<br/>
only now becoming significant. Government’s power to regulate code, to<br/>make behavior within the code regulable, depends in part on the character of<br/>the code. Open code is less regulable than closed code; to the extent that code<br/>becomes open, government’s power is reduced.<br/>
Take for example the most prominent recent controversy in the area of<br/>
copyright—peer-to-peer filesharing. As I’ve described, P2P filesharing is an<br/>application that runs on the network. Filesharing networks like StreamCast<br/>are simply protocols that P2P applications run. All these protocols are open;<br/>anyone can build to them. And because the technology for building to them<br/>is widely available, whether or not a particular company builds to them<br/>doesn’t affect whether they will be built to—but demand does.<br/>
Thus, imagine for the moment that the recording industry is successful in<br/>
driving out of business every business that supports P2P filesharing. The<br/>industry won’t be successful in driving P2P out of existence. This is because<br/>open code has enabled noncommercial actors to sustain the infrastructure of<br/>P2P sharing, without the commercial infrastructure.<br/>
This is not, obviously, an absolute claim. I am discussing relative, not<br/>
absolute, regulability. Even with open code, if the government threatens pun-<br/>ishments that are severe enough, it will induce a certain compliance. And<br/>even with open code, the techniques of identity, tied to code that has been cer-<br/>tified as compliant, will still give government plenty of power. Thus, much of<br/>the argument from Part I survives this point about open code—if the world<br/>becomes certificate-rich, regulability still increases. The same conclusion fol-<br/>lows if more code were burned into hardware rather than left to exist as soft-<br/>ware. Then, even if the code were open, it would not be modifiable.26<br/>
But when designing an architecture for cyberspace, the margins matter.<br/>
The values of a given space are not only the values of speech, autonomy,<br/>access, or privacy. They may also be values of limited control. As John Perry<br/>Barlow puts it, they are the values of a certain bug being programmed into the<br/>architecture of the Net—a bug that inhibits the power of government to con-<br/>trol the Net perfectly, even if it does not disable that power entirely.<br/>
For some, the objective is to build code that disables any possible govern-<br/>
mental control. That is not my objective. I certainly believe that government<br/>must be constrained, and I endorse the constraints that open code imposes,<br/>

the limits in open code<br/>
153<br/>
but it is not my objective to disable government generally. As I’ve argued<br/>already, and as the next part makes plain, some values can be achieved only if<br/>government intervenes. Government has a role, even if not as substantial a<br/>role as it would wish. We need to understand this role, as well as how our val-<br/>ues might be advanced in the context of the Web.<br/>
One constraint seems clear in this account. As I argue more extensively<br/>
later in the book, even if open code does not disable government’s power to<br/>regulate completely, it certainly changes that power. On the margin, open<br/>code reduces the reward from burying regulation in the hidden spaces of<br/>code. It functions as a kind of Freedom of Information Act for network reg-<br/>ulation. As with ordinary law, open code requires that lawmaking be public,<br/>and thus that lawmaking be transparent. In a sense that George Soros ought<br/>to understand, open code is a foundation to an open society.<br/>
Even this is an important—some might say an essential—check on the<br/>
power of government. But whether or not one is for transparency generally,<br/>my aim so far is just to map out the links. Regulability is conditional on the<br/>character of the code, and open code changes that character. It is a limit on<br/>government’s power to regulate—not necessarily by defeating the power to<br/>regulate, but by changing it.<br/>

The story so far has focused on regulation—both the changing regulabil-<br/>ity of behavior in cyberspace (it is increasing) and the distinctive way in<br/>which behavior in cyberspace will be regulated (through code).<br/>
In this Part, I apply the analysis drawn so far to three areas of social<br/>
and political life that will be affected by these changes—intellectual prop-<br/>erty, privacy, and free speech.<br/>
In each of these areas, I will identify values that are relevant. I will<br/>
then ask how those values translate to life online. In some cases, the values<br/>carry over quite directly, but, in others, they produce what I called in<br/>Chapter 2 a “latent ambiguity.” That ambiguity forces us to choose<br/>between two very different conceptions of the value at stake. My aim is not<br/>to make that choice, but instead simply to throw at least two options into<br/>relief.<br/>
I have another objective in each chapter as well. In my view, the most<br/>
important lesson about law in cyberspace is the need for law to account<br/>for the regulatory effect of code. Just as the wise regulator accounts for the<br/>way the market interacts with legal regulation, so too the wise regulator<br/>must account for the ways in which technology interacts with legal regu-<br/>lation. That interaction is often counterintuitive. But unless a regulator<br/>

156<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
takes this interactive effect into account, the regulation—whether to con-<br/>trol behavior or to protect certain liberties—will fail.<br/>
To know what values are relevant, however, we need a method for car-<br/>
rying values into a new context. I begin this part with an account of that<br/>method. The values I will describe are part of our tradition, and they need<br/>to be interpreted and made real in this context. Thus, I begin this part<br/>with one approach that the law has developed for recognizing and respect-<br/>ing these values. This is the interpretive practice I call “translation.” A<br/>translator practices a fidelity to earlier commitments to value. Latent<br/>ambiguities are those instances where fidelity runs out. We have nothing<br/>to be faithful to, because the choices we now face are choices that our for-<br/>bears did not.1<br/>

AT THE HEIGHT OF A PREVIOUS WAR ON DRUGS—PROHIBITION, IN THE LATE<br/>1920s—the federal government began using a technique of police work that<br/>startled many but proved quite effective: wiretapping.1 Life had just begun to<br/>move onto the wires, and, in an effort to take advantage of the evidence that<br/>this new medium might yield, the government began to tap phones without<br/>warrants.<br/>
Because law enforcement officials themselves were conflicted about the<br/>
ethics of wiretapping, taps were used sparingly. Nonetheless, for threats per-<br/>ceived to be extremely grave, the technique was deployed. Illegal alcohol, the<br/>obsession of the age, was just such a threat.<br/>
The most famous of these taps led to the 1928 Supreme Court case <i>Olm-</i><br/>
<i>stead v. United States</i>. The government was investigating one of the largest ille-<br/>gal liquor import, distribution, and sales organizations in the nation. As part<br/>of the investigation, the government began to tap the telephones used by<br/>dealers and their agents. These were private phones, but the taps were always<br/>secured without trespassing on the property of the targets.2 Instead, the taps<br/>were placed on the wires in places where the government had rightful access<br/>to the phone lines.<br/>
Using these taps, the government recorded many hours of conversations<br/>
(775 typewritten pages, according to Justice Louis Brandeis),3 and it used<br/>these recordings to convict the defendants in the case. The defendants chal-<br/>lenged the use of these recordings, claiming that the government had violated<br/>the Constitution in securing them. The Fourth Amendment protects “per-<br/>sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,”<br/>and this wiretapping, the defendants argued, was a violation of their right to<br/>be protected from unreasonable searches.<br/>
157<br/>

158<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Under then-existing law, it was plain that to enter the apartments of<br/>
alleged bootlegger Roy Olmstead and his associates and search them (at least<br/>while they were gone), the government investigators would have needed a<br/>warrant, that is, they would have needed the approval of a judge or magistrate<br/>before invading the defendants’ privacy. This is what the Fourth Amendment<br/>had come to mean—that certain places (persons, houses, papers, and effects)<br/>were protected by presumptively requiring a warrant before they could be<br/>invaded.4 Here there had been no warrant, and hence, as the defendants<br/>argued, the search had been illegal. The evidence had to be excluded.<br/>
We might pause to ask why. If we read the text of the Fourth Amendment<br/>
carefully, it is hard to see just where a warrant is required:<br/>
(a) The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and<br/>
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and<br/>
(b) no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or<br/>
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons<br/>
or things to be seized.<br/>
The Fourth Amendment is really two commands. (I’ve added “a” and “b”<br/>
to help make the point.) The first says that a certain right (“the right of the<br/>People to be secure”) shall not be violated; the second limits the conditions<br/>under which a warrant shall be issued. But the text of the amendment does<br/>not state a relationship between the first part and the second part. And it cer-<br/>tainly does not say that a search is unreasonable if it is not supported by a war-<br/>rant. So why the “warrant requirement”?5<br/>
To make sense of the amendment, we must go back to its framing. At<br/>
that time, the legal protection against the invasion of privacy was trespass<br/>law. If someone entered your property and rifled through your stuff, that per-<br/>son violated your common law rights against trespass. You could sue that<br/>person for trespass, whether he was a police officer or private citizen. The<br/>threat of such suits gave the police an incentive not to invade your privacy.6<br/>
Even without a warrant, however, a trespassing police officer might have a<br/>
number of defenses. These boil down to whether the search was “reasonable.”<br/>But there were two important facts about this reasonableness. First, the deter-<br/>mination of reasonableness was made by a jury. Neighbors and peers of the<br/>officer judged whether his behavior had been proper. Second, in some cases<br/>reasonableness was found as a matter of law—that is, the judge would instruct<br/>the jury to find that the search had been reasonable. (For example, when the<br/>officer found contraband on the property of the defendant, whether there was<br/>sufficient suspicion before the search or not, the search was reasonable.)7<br/>

translation<br/>
159<br/>
This regime created obvious risks for an officer before he searched some-<br/>
one’s property. If he searched and found nothing, or if a jury thought later<br/>that his search had not been reasonable, then he paid for his illegal behavior<br/>by being held personally liable for the rights he had violated.<br/>
But the regime also offered insurance against this liability—the warrant.<br/>
If the officer secured a warrant from a judge before he made his search, the<br/>warrant immunized him against trespass liability. If he then found no contra-<br/>band or his search turned out to be unreasonable, he still had a defense to a<br/>suit.<br/>
Creating incentives was one aim of the original system. The law gave an<br/>
officer an incentive to obtain a warrant before he searched; if he was uncer-<br/>tain, or wanted to avoid all risk of liability, he could first check his judgment<br/>by asking a judge. But if the officer was sure, or wanted to hazard the gamble,<br/>then not getting a warrant did not make the search automatically unreason-<br/>able. He was at risk of increased liability, but his liability was all that was at<br/>stake.<br/>
The weak link in this system was the judge. If judges were too lax, then<br/>
warrants would be too easy to get,8 and weak judges were a concern for the<br/>framers. Under British rule judges had been appointed by the Crown, and by<br/>the time of the Revolution, the Crown was the enemy. Having seen much<br/>abuse of the power to issue warrants, the framers were not keen to give judges<br/>control in determining whether the government’s searches were reasonable.<br/>
In particular (as I described in Chapter 2), the framers had in mind some<br/>
famous cases in which judges and the executive had issued “general warrants”<br/>giving government officers the power to search generally for objects of contra-<br/>band.9 In modern terms, these were “fishing expeditions.” Because the officers<br/>had warrants, they could not be sued; because the judges were largely immune<br/>from suit, they could not be sued. Because no one could be sued, there was a<br/>temptation for abuse. The framers wanted to avoid just such judge-made<br/>abuse. If there was to be immunity, it would come from a jury, or from a suc-<br/>cessful search.<br/>
This is the origin of clause (b) of the Fourth Amendment. The framers<br/>
required that judges, when issuing warrants, name particularly “the place to<br/>be searched, and the persons or things to be seized,” so that judges would not<br/>be able to issue warrants of general power. The immunity of the warrant<br/>would be limited to particular people and places, and only when probable<br/>cause existed to issue the warrant.<br/>
This constitutional regime was designed to balance the people’s interests<br/>
in privacy against the legitimate need for the government to search. The offi-<br/>cer had an incentive to get a warrant (to avoid the risk of personal liability);<br/>

160<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
the judge had a rule that restricted the conditions under which he could issue<br/>a warrant; and together these structures limited official invasions of privacy to<br/>cases that presented a strong reason to invade.<br/>
That much is background. But notice what follows.<br/>The original regime presupposed a great deal. Most obviously, it presup-<br/>
posed a common-law system of trespass law—it was the threat of legal liability<br/>from trespass law that created the incentives for officers to seek warrants in<br/>the first place. This presupposition placed property at the core of the Consti-<br/>tution’s original protections.<br/>
Equally important, the regime presupposed much about the technology<br/>
of the time. The Fourth Amendment focuses on trespass because that was<br/>the primary mode of searching at the time. If it had been possible simply to<br/>view the contents of a house without going inside, the restrictions of the<br/>Fourth Amendment would have made little sense. But the protections of the<br/>amendment did make sense as a way to draw the balance between govern-<br/>ment’s power to search and the people’s right to privacy given the regime of<br/>trespass law and privacy-invading technologies that prevailed at the end of the<br/>eighteenth century.<br/>
Presuppositions—what is taken for granted or considered undebatable—<br/>
change.10 How do we respond when such presuppositions change? How do we<br/>read a text written against a background of certain presuppositions when<br/>those presuppositions no longer apply?<br/>
For Americans, or for any nation with a constitution some two hundred<br/>
years old, this is the central problem for constitutional interpretation. What if<br/>state governments, for example, were simply to abolish rights against trespass?<br/>Would the amendment be read any differently?11 What if technologies for<br/>searching were to change so dramatically that no one would ever need to<br/>enter another’s property to know what is kept there? Should the amendment<br/>then be read differently?<br/>
The history of the Supreme Court’s treatment of such questions lacks a<br/>
perfectly clear pattern, but we can identify two distinct strategies competing<br/>for the Court’s attention. One strategy is focused on what the framers or<br/>founders would have done—the strategy of one-step originalism. The second<br/>strategy aims at finding a current reading of the original Constitution that<br/>preserves its original meaning in the present context—a strategy that I call<br/>translation.<br/>
Both strategies are present in the <i>Olmstead </i>wiretapping case. When the<br/>
government tapped the phones of the defendants without any warrant, the<br/>Court had to decide whether the use of this kind of evidence was permissible<br/>or consistent with the principles of the Fourth Amendment. The defendants<br/>

said: The government must get a warrant to tap phones. The government<br/>said: The Fourth Amendment simply does not apply.<br/>
The government’s argument was quite simple. The amendment presup-<br/>
posed that the government would be trespassing to search, and it was regulat-<br/>ing the conditions under which officers could trespass. But because<br/>wiretapping is an invasion of privacy without a trespass, the government is<br/>able to tap the defendants’ phones without ever entering their property; the<br/>amendment therefore does not apply. It simply does not reach to protect inva-<br/>sions that are invasions without trespass.<br/>
The Supreme Court agreed. In an opinion written by Chief Justice (and<br/>
former President) William Howard Taft, the Court followed the government.<br/>
The amendment does not forbid what was done here. There was no<br/>
searching. There was no seizure. The evidence was secured only by the use of<br/>the sense of hearing and that only. The language of the amendment cannot be<br/>extended and expanded to include telephone wires reaching to the whole<br/>world from the defendant’s house or office.12<br/>
This conclusion was received with surprise and shock. Already much of<br/>
life had moved to the wires. People were beginning to understand what it<br/>meant to have intimate contact “online”; they counted on the telephone sys-<br/>tem to protect their intimate secrets. Indeed, telephone companies, having<br/>strongly fought the authority that the government claimed, pledged not to<br/>assist the government except as required by law.13 This resistance notwith-<br/>standing, the Court concluded that the Constitution did not interfere with<br/>invasions of this sort. It would not have done so when the Constitution was<br/>written; it did not do so at the time when the case was decided.<br/>
But the dissent written by Justice Brandeis (there was also a dissent by Jus-<br/>
tices Holmes, Stone, and Butler) had a different view. As with Taft’s opinion,<br/>the focus was fidelity. But his fidelity was quite differently conceived.<br/>
Brandeis acknowledged that the Fourth Amendment, as originally writ-<br/>
ten, applied only to trespass.14 But it did so, he argued, because when it was<br/>written trespass was the technology for invading privacy. That was the<br/>framers’ presupposition, but that presupposition had now changed. Given<br/>this change, Brandeis argued, it was the Court’s responsibility to read the<br/>amendment in a way that preserved its meaning, changed circumstances<br/>notwithstanding. The aim must be to translate the original protections into a<br/>context in which the technology for invading privacy had changed.15 This<br/>would be done, Brandeis argued, by applying the Fourth Amendment’s pro-<br/>tection to invasions that were not themselves trespasses.<br/>
These two opinions mark two different modes of constitutional interpre-<br/>
tation. Taft finds fidelity by simply repeating what the framers did; Brandeis<br/>

162<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
finds fidelity by finding the current equivalent to what the framers did. If we<br/>followed Taft, Brandeis argued, we would defeat the protections for privacy<br/>that the framers originally set; if we followed Brandeis, Taft implied, we would<br/>be adding something to the Constitution that the framers had not written.<br/>
Partisans on both sides claimed that the opinion of the other would have<br/>
“changed” the meaning of the Constitution. But whose opinion, the Court’s<br/>or Justice Brandeis’s, would really “change” the meaning of the Fourth<br/>Amendment?<br/>
To answer this question, we must first ask: Change relative to what? What<br/>
is the baseline against which this change is a change? Certainly Brandeis<br/>would have agreed that in 1791 any finding by the Court that the amendment<br/>reached beyond trespass would have been improper. But when something<br/>presupposed by the original amendment has changed, is it clear that the<br/>Court’s proper response is to act as if nothing has changed at all?<br/>
Brandeis’s method accounted for the changed presupposition. He offered<br/>
a reading that changed the scope of the amendment in order to maintain the<br/>amendment’s protection of privacy. Taft, on the other hand, offered a reading<br/>that maintained the scope of the amendment but changed its protection of<br/>privacy. Each reading kept something constant; each also changed something.<br/>The question is: Which reading preserved what fidelity demands should be<br/>preserved?<br/>
We might better see the point through a somewhat stylized re-creation.<br/>
Imagine that we could quantify privacy; we could thus describe the change in<br/>the quantity of privacy that any change in technology might bring. (Robert<br/>Post has given an absolutely persuasive argument about why privacy is not<br/>quantifiable, but my purposes here are simply illustrative.16) Imagine that in<br/>1791 protecting against physical trespass protected 90 percent of personal<br/>privacy. The government could still stand on the street and listen through<br/>open windows, but the invasion presented by that threat was small, all things<br/>considered. For the most part, a regime that protected against trespass also<br/>protected privacy.<br/>
When telephones came along, however, this protection changed. A lot of<br/>
private information was put out across the phone lines. Now, if tapping was<br/>not trespass, much less of private life was protected from government snoop-<br/>ing. Rather than 90 percent being protected by the amendment, only 50 per-<br/>cent was protected.<br/>
Brandeis wanted to read the amendment so that it protected the 90 per-<br/>
cent it originally protected—even though doing so required that it protect<br/>against more than simple trespass. He wanted to read it differently, we could<br/>say, so that it protected the same.<br/>

This form of argument is common in our constitutional history, and it is<br/>
central to the best in our constitutional tradition.17 It is an argument that<br/>responds to changed circumstances by proposing a reading that neutralizes<br/>those changes and preserves an original meaning. It is an argument invoked<br/>by justices on both the right and the left,18 and it is a way to keep life in a con-<br/>stitutional provision—to make certain that changes in the world do not<br/>change the meaning of the Constitution’s text. It is an argument, we can say,<br/>that aims at translating the protections that the Fourth Amendment gave in<br/>1791 into the same set of protections at any time later in our history. It<br/>acknowledges that to do this the Court may have to read the amendment dif-<br/>ferently, but it is not reading the amendment differently to improve the<br/>amendment or to add to its protections. It is reading the amendment differ-<br/>ently to accommodate the changes in protection that have resulted from<br/>changes in technology. It is translation to preserve meaning.<br/>
If there is a justice who deserves cyberspace’s praise, if there is a Supreme<br/>
Court opinion that should be the model for cyber activists in the future, if<br/>there is a first chapter in the fight to protect cyberspace, it is this justice, this<br/>opinion, and this case. Brandeis gave us a model for reading the Constitution<br/>to preserve its meaning, and its values, across time and context. It is a method<br/>that recognizes what has changed and accommodates that change to preserve<br/>something of what the framers originally gave us. It is a method that translates<br/>the Constitution’s meaning across fundamentally different contexts—whether<br/>they are as temporally distant as we are from the framers or as distant as<br/>cyberspace is from real space.<br/>
But it was Taft’s opinion that became law and his narrow view of the<br/>
Fourth Amendment that prevailed. It took forty years for the Supreme Court<br/>to embrace Brandeis’s picture of the Fourth Amendment—40 years before<br/><i>Olmstead </i>was overruled. The case overruling it was <i>Katz v. United States</i>.19<br/>
Charles Katz was suspected of transmitting gambling information to<br/>
clients in other states by telephone. Federal agents recorded his half of several<br/>of his telephone calls by attaching an eavesdropping device to the outside of<br/>a public phone booth where he made his calls. Katz was convicted on the<br/>basis of this evidence, and the court of appeals upheld the conviction on the<br/>basis of <i>Olmstead</i>.<br/>
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe was involved in the case at<br/>
the beginning of his legal career:<br/>
As a [law] clerk to Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, I found myself working on<br/>
a case involving the government’s electronic surveillance of a suspected criminal in<br/>
the form of a tiny device attached to the outside of a public telephone booth. Because<br/>

164<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
the invasion of the suspect’s privacy was accomplished without physical trespass<br/>
into a “constitutionally protected area,” the Federal Government argued, relying<br/>
upon <i>Olmstead, </i>that there had been no “search” or “seizure” and therefore the Fourth<br/>
Amendment “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and<br/>
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures” simply did not apply.<br/>
At first, there were only four votes to overrule <i>Olmstead </i>and to hold the Fourth<br/>
Amendment applicable to wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping. I’m proud to<br/>
say that, as a 26-year-old kid, I had at least a little bit to do with changing that num-<br/>
ber from four to seven—and with the argument, formally adopted by a seven-Justice<br/>
majority in December 1967, that the Fourth Amendment “protects people, not<br/>
places” [389 US at 351]. In that decision, <i>Katz v. United States, </i>the Supreme Court<br/>
finally repudiated <i>Olmstead </i>and the many decisions that had relied upon it, reason-<br/>
ing that, given the role of electronic telecommunications in modern life, the [First<br/>
Amendment] purposes of protecting free speech as well as the [Fourth Amendment]<br/>
purposes of protecting privacy require treating as a “search” any invasion of a per-<br/>
son’s confidential telephone communications, with or without physical trespass.20<br/>
The Court in <i>Katz </i>followed Brandeis rather than Taft. It sought a reading<br/>
of the Fourth Amendment that made sense of the amendment in a changed<br/>context. In the framers’ context of 1791, protecting against trespass to prop-<br/>erty was an effective way to protect against trespass to privacy, but in the <i>Katz<br/></i>context of the 1960s it was not. In the 1960s much of intimate life was con-<br/>ducted in places where property rules did not reach (in the “ether,” for exam-<br/>ple, of the AT&amp;T telephone network). And so a regime that made privacy<br/>hang on property did not protect privacy to the same degree that the framers<br/>had intended. Justice Stewart in <i>Katz </i>sought to remedy that by linking the<br/>Fourth Amendment to a more direct protection of privacy.<br/>
The link was the idea of “a reasonable expectation of privacy.” The core<br/>
value, Stewart wrote, was the protection of “people, not places.”21 Hence, the<br/>core technique should be to protect people where they have a reasonable<br/>expectation of privacy. Where this is the case, the government cannot invade<br/>that space without satisfying the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.<br/>
There is much to admire in Stewart’s opinion, at least to the extent that he<br/>
is willing to fashion tools for preserving the Constitution’s meaning in<br/>changed circumstances—or again, to the extent that he attempts to translate<br/>the protections of the Fourth Amendment into a modern context. There is<br/>also much to question.22 But we can put those questions aside for the moment<br/>and focus on one feature of the problem that is fairly uncontentious.<br/>
While lines will be hard to draw, it is at least fairly clear that the framers<br/>
made a conscious choice to protect privacy. This was not an issue off the table<br/>

translation<br/>
165<br/>
of their original debate or a question they did not notice. And this is not the<br/>“right to privacy” that conservatives complain about in the context of the<br/>right to abortion. This is the right to be free from state intrusion into the<br/>“sanctity” of a private home. State-enforced threats to individual privacy were<br/>at the center of the movement that led to the republic. Brandeis and Stewart<br/>simply aimed to effect that choice in contexts where the earlier structure had<br/>grown ineffectual.<br/>
Translations like these are fairly straightforward. The original values cho-<br/>
sen are fairly clear; the way in which contexts undermine the original appli-<br/>cation is easily grasped; and the readings that would restore the original values<br/>are fairly obvious. Of course, such cases often require a certain interpretive<br/>courage—a willingness to preserve interpretive fidelity by changing an inter-<br/>pretive practice. But at least the direction is clear, even if the means are a bit<br/>unseemly.23<br/>
These are the easy cases. They are even easier when we are not trying to<br/>
carry values from some distant past into the future but instead are simply<br/>carrying values from one context into another. When we know what values we<br/>want to preserve, we need only be creative about how to preserve them.<br/>
Cyberspace will present many such easy cases. When courts confront<br/>
them, they should follow the example of Brandeis: They should translate, and<br/>they should push the Supreme Court to do likewise. Where circumstances<br/>have changed to nullify the protections of some original right, the Court<br/>should adopt a reading of the Constitution that restores that right.<br/>
But some cases will not be so easy. Sometimes translation will not be an<br/>
option, and sometimes the values that translation would track are values we<br/>no longer want to preserve. Sometimes we cannot tell which values translation<br/>would select. This was the problem in Chapter 2 with the worm, which made<br/>the point about latent ambiguities. Changing contexts sometimes reveals an<br/>ambiguity latent in the original context. We must then choose between two<br/>different values, either of which could be said to be consistent with the orig-<br/>inal value. Since either way could be said to be right, we cannot say that the<br/>original context (whether now or two hundred years ago) decided the case.<br/>
Professor Tribe describes an example in a founding article in the law of<br/>
cyberspace, “The Constitution in Cyberspace.”24 Tribe sketches a method of<br/>reading the Constitution in cyberspace that aims to make the Constitution<br/>“technologically neutral.” The objective is to adopt readings (or perhaps even<br/>an amendment) that make it plain that changes in technology are not to<br/>change the Constitution’s meaning. We must always adopt readings of the<br/>Constitution that preserve its original values. When dealing with cyberspace,<br/>judges are to be translators: Different technologies are the different languages,<br/>

166<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
and the aim is to find a reading of the Constitution that preserves its meaning<br/>from one world’s technology to another.25<br/>
This is fidelity as translation. This kind of translation speaks as if it is<br/>
just carrying over something that has already been said. It hides the creativity<br/>in its act; it feigns a certain polite or respectful deference. This way of reading<br/>the Constitution insists that the important political decisions have already<br/>been made and all that is required is a kind of technical adjustment. It aims to<br/>keep the piano in tune as it is moved from one concert hall to another.<br/>
But Tribe then offers an example that may make this method seem empty.<br/>
The question is about the meaning of the confrontation clause of the Sixth<br/>Amendment—the defendant’s right in a criminal trial “to be confronted with<br/>the witnesses against him.” How, Tribe asks, should we read this clause today?<br/>
At the time of the founding, he argues, the technology of confrontation<br/>
was simple—confrontation was two-way. If a witness confronted the accused,<br/>the accused, of necessity, confronted the witness. This was a necessity given to<br/>us by the technology of the time. But today it is possible for confrontation to<br/>be one-way—the witness confronts the accused, but the accused need not<br/>confront the witness. The question then is whether the confrontation clause<br/>requires one-way or two-way confrontation.26<br/>
Let us grant that Tribe’s descriptions of the available technologies are<br/>
correct and that the framers embraced the only confrontation clause that<br/>their technology permitted. The real question comes in step two. Now that<br/>technology allows two possibilities—one-way or two-way confrontation—<br/>which does the Constitution require?<br/>
The Court’s answer in its 1990 decision in <i>Maryland v. Craig </i>was clear:<br/>
The Constitution requires only one-way confrontation. A confrontation<br/>clause regime that permits only one-way confrontation, at least when there are<br/>strong interests in not requiring two, is a fair translation of the original<br/>clause.27<br/>
As a matter of political choice, I certainly like this answer. But I do not see<br/>
its source. It seems to me that this is a question the framers did not decide,<br/>and a question that if presented to them might well have divided them. Given<br/>the technology of 1791, they did not have to decide between one-way and<br/>two-way confrontation; given the conflict of values at stake, it is not obvious<br/>how they would have decided it. Thus, to speak as if there were an answer here<br/>that the framers gave us is a bit misleading. The framers gave no answer here,<br/>and, in my view, no answer can be drawn from what they said.<br/>
Like the worm in Chapter 2, the confrontation clause presents a latent<br/>
ambiguity.28 Constitutional law in cyberspace will reveal many more such<br/>latent ambiguities. And these ambiguities offer us a choice: How will we go on?<br/>

Choices are not terrible. It is not a disaster if we must make a decision—<br/>
as long as we are capable of it. But here is the nub of the problem as I see it.<br/>As I argue in more detail in Part IV, given the current attitudes of our courts,<br/>and our legal culture generally, constitutional choices are costly. We are bad at<br/>making them; we are not likely to get better at it soon.<br/>
When there is no answer about how to proceed—when the translation<br/>
leaves open a question—we have two sorts of responses in constitutional<br/>practice. One response is passive: The court simply lets the legislature decide.<br/>This is the response that Justice Scalia presses in the context of the Fourteenth<br/>Amendment. On matters that, to the framers, were “undebatable,” the Consti-<br/>tution does not speak.29 In this case, only the legislature can engage and press<br/>questions of constitutional value and thus say what the Constitution will con-<br/>tinue to mean.<br/>
The second response is more active: The court finds a way to articulate<br/>
constitutional values that were not present at the founding. The courts help<br/>spur a conversation about these fundamental values—or at least add their<br/>voice to this conversation—to focus a debate that may ultimately be resolved<br/>elsewhere. The first response is a way of doing nothing; the second is a way of<br/>exciting a dialogue about constitutional values as a means to confronting and<br/>resolving new questions.30<br/>
My fear about cyberspace is that we will respond in the first way—that the<br/>
courts, the institutions most responsible for articulating constitutional values,<br/>will stand back while issues of constitutional import are legislatively deter-<br/>mined. My sense is that they will step back because they feel (as the balance of<br/>this book argues) that these are new questions that cyberspace has raised.<br/>Their newness will make them feel political, and when a question feels polit-<br/>ical, courts step away from resolving it.<br/>
I fear this not because I fear legislatures, but because in our day constitu-<br/>
tional discourse at the level of the legislature is a very thin sort of discourse.<br/>The philosopher Bernard Williams has argued that because the Supreme<br/>Court has taken so central a role in the articulation of constitutional values,<br/>legislatures no longer do.31 Whether Williams is correct or not, this much is<br/>clear: The constitutional discourse of our present Congress is far below the<br/>level at which it must be to address the questions about constitutional values<br/>that will be raised by cyberspace.<br/>
How we could reach beyond this thinness of discourse is unclear. Consti-<br/>
tutional thought has been the domain of lawyers and judges for too long. We<br/>have been trapped by a mode of reasoning that pretends that all the important<br/>questions have already been answered, that our job now is simply to translate<br/>them for modern times. As a result, we do not quite know how to proceed<br/>

168<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
when we think the answers are not already there. As nations across the world<br/>struggle to express and embrace constitutional values, we, with the oldest<br/>written constitutional tradition, have lost the practice of embracing, articulat-<br/>ing, and deciding on constitutional values.<br/>
I return to this problem in Chapter 15. For now, my point is simply<br/>
descriptive. Translation is one way to deal with the choices that cyberspace<br/>presents. It is one way of finding equivalence across contexts. But in the four<br/>applications that follow, I press the question: Is the past enough? Are there<br/>choices the framers did not address? Are they choices that we must make?32<br/>

HAROLD REEVES IS AMONG THE BEST RESEARCH ASSISTANTS I HAVE HAD. (BUT ALAS,<br/>the law has now lost him—he’s become a priest!). Early into his second year<br/>at the University of Chicago Law School, he came to me with an idea he had<br/>for a student “comment”—an article that would be published in the law<br/>review.1 The topic was trespass law in cyberspace—whether and how the law<br/>should protect owners of space in cyberspace from the kinds of intrusions<br/>that trespass law protects against in real space. His initial idea was simple:<br/>There should be no trespass law in cyberspace.2 The law should grant “own-<br/>ers” of space in cyberspace no legal protection against invasion; they should<br/>be forced to fend for themselves.<br/>
Reeves’s idea was a bit nutty, and in the end, I think, wrong.3 But it con-<br/>
tained an insight that was quite brilliant, and that should be central to think-<br/>ing about law in cyberspace.<br/>
The idea—much more briefly and much less elegantly than Reeves has<br/>
put it—is this: The question that law should ask is, What means would bring<br/>about the most efficient set of protections for property interests in cyberspace?<br/>Two sorts of protections are possible. One is the traditional protection of<br/>law—the law defines a space where others should not enter and punishes<br/>people who enter nonetheless. The other protection is a fence, a technological<br/>device (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the unwanted from<br/>entering. In real space, of course, we have both—law, in the form of trespass<br/>law, and fences that supplement that law. Both cost money, and the return<br/>from each is not necessarily the same. From a social perspective, we would<br/>want the mix that provides optimal protection at the lowest cost. (In eco-<br/>nomics-speak, we would want a mix such that the marginal cost of an addi-<br/>tional unit of protection is equivalent to the marginal benefit.)<br/>
169<br/>

The implication of this idea in real space is that it sometimes makes sense<br/>
to shift the burden of protection to citizens rather than to the state. If, for<br/>example, a farmer wants to store some valuable seed on a remote part of his<br/>farm, it is better for him to bear the cost of fencing in the seed than to require<br/>the police to patrol the area more consistently or to increase the punishment<br/>for those they catch. The question is always one of balance between the costs<br/>and benefits of private protection and state protection.<br/>
Reeves’s insight about cyberspace follows the same line. The optimal<br/>
protection for spaces in cyberspace is a mix between public law and private<br/>fences. The question to ask in determining the mix is which protection, on<br/>the margin, costs less. Reeves argues that the costs of law in this context are<br/>extremely high—in part because of the costs of enforcement, but also<br/>because it is hard for the law to distinguish between legitimate and illegiti-<br/>mate uses of cyberspaces. There are many “agents” that might “use” the<br/>space of cyberspace. Web spiders, which gather data for web search engines;<br/>browsers, who are searching across the Net for stuff to see; hackers (of the<br/>good sort) who are testing the locks of spaces to see that they are locked; and<br/>hackers (of the bad sort) who are breaking and entering to steal. It is hard,<br/>ex ante, for the law to know which agent is using the space legitimately and<br/>which is not. Legitimacy depends on the intention of the person granting<br/>access.<br/>
So that led Reeves to his idea: Since the intent of the “owner” is so crucial<br/>
here, and since the fences of cyberspace can be made to reflect that intent<br/>cheaply, it is best to put all the incentive on the owner to define access as he<br/>wishes. The right to browse should be the norm, and the burden to lock doors<br/>should be placed on the owner.4<br/>
Now put Reeves’s argument aside, and think for a second about some-<br/>
thing that will seem completely different but is very much the same idea.<br/>Think about “theft” and the protections that we have against it.<br/>
• I have a stack of firewood behind my house. No one steals it. If I left my bike out<br/>
overnight, it would be gone.<br/>
• A friend told me that, in a favorite beach town, the city used to find it impossible<br/>
to plant flowers—they would immediately be picked. But now, he proudly<br/>
reports, after a long “community spirit” campaign, the flowers are no longer<br/>
picked.<br/>
• There are special laws about the theft of automobiles, planes, and boats. There<br/>
are no special laws about the theft of skyscrapers. Cars, planes, and boats need<br/>
protection. Skyscrapers pretty much take care of themselves.<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
171<br/>
Many things protect property against theft—differently. The market pro-<br/>
tects my firewood (it is cheaper to buy your own than it is to haul mine away);<br/>the market is a special threat to my bike (which if taken is easily sold). Norms<br/>sometimes protect flowers in a park; sometimes they do not. Nature some-<br/>times conspires with thieves (cars, planes, and boats) and sometimes against<br/>them (skyscrapers).<br/>
These protections are not fixed. I could lock my bike and thereby use<br/>
real-space code to make it harder to steal. There could be a shortage of fire-<br/>wood; demand would increase, making it harder to protect. Public campaigns<br/>about civic beauty might stop flower theft; selecting a distinctive flower might<br/>do the same. Sophisticated locks might make stolen cars useless; sophisticated<br/>bank fraud might make skyscrapers vulnerable. The point is not that protec-<br/>tions are given, or unchangeable, but that they are multiplied and their<br/>modalities different.<br/>
Property is protected by the sum of the different protections that law,<br/>
norms, the market, and real-space code yield. This is the implication of the<br/>argument made in Chapter 7. From the point of view of the state, we need law<br/>only when the other three modalities leave property vulnerable. From the<br/>point of view of the citizen, real-space code (such as locks) is needed when laws<br/>and norms alone do not protect enough. Understanding how property is pro-<br/>tected means understanding how these different protections work together.<br/>
Reeves’s idea and these reflections on firewood and skyscrapers point to<br/>
the different ways that law might protect “property” and suggest the range of<br/>kinds of property that law might try to protect. They also invite a question<br/>that has been asked by Justice Stephen Breyer and many others: Should law<br/>protect some kinds of property—in particular, intellectual property—at all?5<br/>
Among the kinds of property law might protect, my focus in this chapter<br/>
will be on the property protected by copyright.6 Of all the different types of<br/>property, this type is said to be the most vulnerable to the changes that cyber-<br/>space will bring. Many believe that intellectual property cannot be protected<br/>in cyberspace. And in the terms that I’ve sketched, we can begin to see why<br/>one might think this, but we will soon see that this thought must be wrong.<br/>
ON THE REPORTS OF COPYRIGHT’S DEMISE<br/>
Roughly put, copyright gives a copyright holder certain exclusive rights over<br/>the work, including, most famously, the exclusive right to copy the work. I<br/>have a copyright in this book. That means, among other rights, and subject to<br/>some important exceptions, you cannot copy this book without my permis-<br/>sion. The right is protected to the extent that laws (and norms) support it, and<br/>

172<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
it is threatened to the extent that technology makes it easy to copy. Strengthen<br/>the law while holding technology constant, and the right is stronger. Prolifer-<br/>ate copying technology while holding the law constant, and the right is<br/>weaker.<br/>
In this sense, copyright has always been at war with technology. Before the<br/>
printing press, there was not much need to protect an author’s interest in his<br/>creative work. Copying was so expensive that nature itself protected that inter-<br/>est. But as the cost of copying decreased, and the spread of technologies for<br/>copying increased, the threat to the author’s control increased. As each gener-<br/>ation has delivered a technology better than the last, the ability of the copy-<br/>right holder to protect her intellectual property has been weakened.<br/>
Until recently, the law’s response to these changes has been measured and<br/>
gradual. When technologies to record and reproduce sound emerged at the<br/>turn of the last century, composers were threatened by them. The law responded<br/>by giving composers a new, but limited, right to profit from recordings. When<br/>radio began broadcasting music, the composers were held to be entitled to<br/>compensation for the public performance of their work, but performers were<br/>not compensated for the “performance” of their recordings. Congress decided<br/>not to remedy that problem. When cable television started rebroadcasting tel-<br/>evision broadcasts, the copyright holders in the original broadcasts complained<br/>their work was being exploited without compensation. Congress responded by<br/>granting the copyright holders a new, but limited, right to profit from the<br/>rebroadcasts. When the VCR made it simple to record copyrighted content<br/>from off the air, copyright holders cried “piracy.” Congress decided not to<br/>respond to that complaint. Sometimes the change in technology inspired Con-<br/>gress to create new rights, and sometimes not. But throughout this history, new<br/>technologies have been embraced as they have enabled the spread of culture.<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
During the same period, norms about copyrighted content also evolved. But<br/>the single, defining feature of these norms can perhaps be summarized like<br/>this: that a consumer could do with the copyrighted content that he legally<br/>owned anything he wanted to do, without ever triggering the law of copyright.<br/>This norm was true almost by definition until 1909, since before then, the law<br/>didn’t regulate “copies.” Any use the consumer made of copyrighted content<br/>was therefore highly unlikely to trigger any of the exclusive rights of copyright.<br/>After 1909, though the law technically regulated “copies,” the technologies to<br/>make copies were broadly available. There was a struggle about Xerox<br/>machines, which forced a bit of reform,7 but the first real conflict that copy-<br/>right law had with consumers happened when cassette tapes made it easy to<br/>copy recorded music. Some of that copying was for the purpose of making a<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
173<br/>
“mixed tape,” and some was simply for the purpose of avoiding the need to buy<br/>the original recording. After many years of debate, Congress decided not to leg-<br/>islate a ban on home taping. Instead, in the Audio Home Recording Act, Con-<br/>gress signaled fairly clear exemptions from copyright for such consumer<br/>activity. These changes reinforced the norm among consumers that they were<br/>legally free to do whatever they wanted with copyrighted work. Given the tech-<br/>nologies most consumers had access to, the stuff they wanted to do either did<br/>not trigger copyright (e.g., resell their books to a used bookstore), or if it did,<br/>the law was modified to protect it (e.g., cassette tapes).<br/>
Against the background of these gradual changes in the law, along with the<br/>
practical norm that, in the main, the law didn’t reach consumers, the changes of<br/>digital technology were a considerable shock. First, from the perspective of tech-<br/>nology, digital technologies, unlike their analog sister, enabled perfect copies of<br/>an original work. The return from copying was therefore greater. Second, also<br/>from the perspective of technology, the digital technology of the Internet enabled<br/>content to be freely (and effectively anonymously) distributed across the Internet.<br/>The availability of copies was therefore greater. Third, from the perspective of<br/>norms, consumers who had internalized the norm that they could do with “their<br/>content” whatever they wanted used these new digital tools to make “their con-<br/>tent” available widely on the Internet. Companies such as Napster helped fuel<br/>this behavior, but the practice existed both before and after Napster. And fourth,<br/>from the perspective of law, because the base technology of the Internet didn’t<br/>reveal anything about the nature of the content being shared on the Internet, or<br/>about who was doing the sharing, there was little the law could do to stop this<br/>massive “sharing” of content. Thus fifth, and from the perspective of copyright<br/>holders, digital technologies and the Internet were the perfect storm for their<br/>business model: If they made money by controlling the distribution of “copies”<br/>of copyrighted content, you could well understand why they viewed the Internet<br/>as a grave threat.<br/>
Very quickly, and quite early on, the content industry responded to this<br/>
threat. Their first line of defense was a more aggressive regime of regulation.<br/>Because, the predictions of cyberspace mavens notwithstanding, not everyone<br/>was willing to concede that copyright law was dead. Intellectual property<br/>lawyers and interest groups pushed early on to have law shore up the protec-<br/>tions of intellectual property that cyberspace seemed certain to erase.<br/>
LAW TO THE RESCUE<br/>
The initial response to this push was a White Paper produced by the Com-<br/>merce Department in 1995. The paper outlined a series of modifications<br/>

174<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
aimed, it said, at restoring “balance” in intellectual property law. Entitled<br/>“Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure,” the<br/>report sought to restate existing intellectual property law in terms that anyone<br/>could understand, as well as to recommend changes in the law in response to<br/>the changes the Net would bring. But as scholars quickly pointed out, the<br/>first part was a bust.8 The report no more “restated” existing law than Soviet<br/>historians “retold” stories of Stalin’s administration. The restatement had a<br/>tilt, very definitely in the direction of increased intellectual property protec-<br/>tion, but it pretended that its tilt was the natural lay of the land.<br/>
For our purposes, however, it is the recommendations that were most<br/>
significant. The government proposed four responses to the threat presented<br/>by cyberspace. In the terms of Chapter 7, these responses should be familiar.<br/>
The first response was traditional. The government proposed changes in<br/>
the law of copyright to “clarify” the rights that it was to protect.9 These<br/>changes were intended to better define the rights granted under intellectual<br/>property law and to further support these rights with clarified (and possibly<br/>greater) legal penalties for their violation.<br/>
The second response addressed norms, specifically copying norms. The<br/>
report recommended increased educational efforts, both in schools and<br/>among the general public, about the nature of intellectual property and the<br/>importance of protecting it. In the terms of Chapter 7, this is the use of law<br/>to change norms so that norms will better support the protection of intellec-<br/>tual property. It is an indirect regulation of behavior by direct regulation of<br/>norms.<br/>
The third and fourth responses mixed technology and the market. The<br/>
report called for legal support—through financial subsidies and special legal<br/>protection—of “copyright management schemes.” These “schemes” were sim-<br/>ply technologies that would make it easier to control access to and use of<br/>copyrighted material. We will explore these “schemes” at some length later in<br/>this chapter, but I mention them now as another example of indirect regula-<br/>tion—using the market to subsidize the development of a certain software<br/>tool, and using law to regulate the properties of other software tools. Copy-<br/>right management systems would be supported by government funding and<br/>by the threat of criminal sanctions for anyone deploying software to crack<br/>them.10<br/>
Congress followed the recommendations of the 1995 White Paper in some<br/>
respects. The most important was the enactment of the Digital Millennium<br/>Copyright Act in 1998. That statute implemented directly the recommendation<br/>that “technological protection measures” be protected by law. Code that some-<br/>one implements to control either access to or use of a copyrighted work got<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
175<br/>
special legal protection under the DMCA: Circumvention of that code, subject<br/>to a few important exceptions, constituted a violation of the law.<br/>
We will return to the DMCA later. The point just now, however, is to rec-<br/>
ognize something important about the presumption underlying the White<br/>Paper. The 1995 package of proposals was a scattershot of techniques—some<br/>changes in law, some support for changing norms, and lots of support for<br/>changing the code of cyberspace to make it better able to protect intellectual<br/>property. Perhaps nothing better than this could have been expected in<br/>1995—the law promised a balance of responses to deal with the shifting bal-<br/>ance brought on by cyberspace.<br/>
Balance is attractive, and moderation seems right. But something is miss-<br/>
ing from this approach. The White Paper proceeds as if the problem of pro-<br/>tecting intellectual property in cyberspace was just like the problem of<br/>protecting intellectual property in real space. It proceeds as if the four con-<br/>straints would operate in the same proportions as in real space, as if nothing<br/>fundamental had changed.<br/>
But something fundamental has changed: the role that code plays in the<br/>
protection of intellectual property. Code can, and increasingly will, displace<br/>law as the primary defense of intellectual property in cyberspace. Private<br/>fences, not public law.<br/>
The White Paper did not see this. Built into its scattershot of ideas is one<br/>
that is crucial to its approach but fundamentally incorrect—the idea that the<br/>nature of cyberspace is anarchy. The White Paper promises to strengthen law<br/>in every area it can. But it approaches the question like a ship battening down<br/>for a storm: Whatever happens, the threat to copyright is real, damage will be<br/>done, and the best we can do is ride it out.<br/>
This is fundamentally wrong. We are not entering a time when copyright<br/>
is more threatened than it is in real space. We are instead entering a time<br/>when copyright is more effectively protected than at any time since Guten-<br/>berg. The power to regulate access to and use of copyrighted material is about<br/>to be perfected. Whatever the mavens of the mid-1990s may have thought,<br/>cyberspace is about to give holders of copyrighted property the biggest gift of<br/>protection they have ever known.<br/>
In such an age, the real question for law is not, how can law aid in that<br/>
protection? but rather, is the protection too great? The mavens were right<br/>when they predicted that cyberspace will teach us that everything we thought<br/>about copyright was wrong.11 But the lesson in the future will be that copy-<br/>right is protected far too well. The problem will center not on copy-right but<br/>on copy-duty—the duty of owners of protected property to make that prop-<br/>erty accessible.<br/>

176<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
That’s a big claim. To see it, however, and to see the consequences it<br/>
entails, we need consider three examples. The first is a vision of a researcher<br/>from Xerox PARC (appropriately enough), Mark Stefik, and his idea of<br/>“trusted systems.”12 The second is an implication of a world dominated by<br/>trusted systems. The third is an unreckoned cost to the path we are now on to<br/>“protect intellectual property.” The examples will throw into relief the threat<br/>that these changes present for values that our tradition considers fundamen-<br/>tal. They should force us to make a choice about those values, and about their<br/>place in our future.<br/>
THE PROMISE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN CYBERSPACE<br/>
<i>It all depends on whether you really understand the idea of trusted sys-<br/>tems. If you don’t understand them, then this whole approach to com-<br/>merce and digital publishing is utterly unthinkable. If you do<br/>understand them, then it all follows easily.</i><br/>
Ralph Merkle, quoted in Stefik, “Letting Loose the Light” (1996)<br/>
In what we can call the first generation of digital technologies, content<br/>
owners were unable to control who copied what. If you have a copy of a copy-<br/>righted photo rendered in a graphics file, you could make unlimited copies of<br/>that file with no effect on the original. When you make the one-hundredth<br/>copy, nothing would indicate that it was the one-hundredth copy rather than<br/>the first. And as we’ve described again and again, in the original code of the<br/>Internet, there was nothing to regulate how or to whom copyrighted content<br/>was distributed. The function of “copying” as it was developed by the coders<br/>who built it, either in computers or networks, aimed at “copying”—not at<br/>“copying” with specified permissions.<br/>
This character to the function “copy” was not unique to cyberspace. We<br/>
have seen a technology that presented the same problem, and I’ve already<br/>described how a solution was subsequently built into the technology.13 Digital<br/>Audio Tape (DAT) technology was thought to be a threat to copyright owners.<br/>A number of solutions to this threat were proposed. Some people argued for<br/>higher penalties for illegal copying of tapes (direct regulation by law). Some,<br/>such as Richard Stallman, argued for a tax on blank tapes, with the proceeds<br/>compensating copyright holders (indirect regulation of the market by law).<br/>Some argued for better education to stop illegal copies of tapes (indirect reg-<br/>ulation of norms by law). But some argued for a change in the code of DAT<br/>machines that would block unlimited perfect copying.<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
177<br/>
The tax and code regulators won. In late 1992, as a compromise between<br/>
the technology and content industries, Congress passed the Audio Home<br/>Recording Act. The act first imposed a tax on both recorders and blank DAT<br/>media, with the revenues to be used to compensate copyright holders for the<br/>expected copyright infringement enabled by the technology. But more inter-<br/>estingly, the Act required manufacturers of DAT technology to include a Serial<br/>Copy Management System, which would limit the ability of DAT technology<br/>to copy. That limit was effected through a code inserted in copies made using<br/>DAT technology. From an original, the technology would always permit a<br/>copy. But from a copy made on a DAT recorder, no further digital copy could<br/>be made. (An analog copy could be made, thus degrading the quality of the<br/>copy, but not a perfect digital copy.) The technology was thus designed to<br/>break the “copy” function under certain conditions, so as to indirectly protect<br/>copyright owners. The net effect of these two changes was to minimize any<br/>harm from the technology, as well as to limit the functionality of the technol-<br/>ogy where it would be expected that functionality would encourage the vio-<br/>lation of copyright. (Many think the net effect of this regulation also killed<br/>DAT technology.)<br/>
Something like the same idea animated Stefik’s vision.14 He was not keen<br/>
to make the quality of copies decrease. Rather, his objective was to make it<br/>possible to track and control the copies of digital content that are made.15<br/>
Think of the proposal like this. Today, when you buy a book, you may do<br/>
any number of things with it. You can read it once or one hundred times. You<br/>can lend it to a friend. You can photocopy pages in it or scan it into your<br/>computer. You can burn it, use it as a paperweight, or sell it. You can store it<br/>on your shelf and never once open it.<br/>
Some of these things you can do because the law gives you the right to do<br/>
them—you can sell the book, for example, because the copyright law explicitly<br/>limits the copyright owner’s right to control your use of the physical book<br/>after the “first sale.” Other things you can do because there is no effective way<br/>to stop you. A book seller might sell you the book at one price if you promise<br/>to read it once, and at a different price if you want to read it one hundred<br/>times, but there is no way for the seller to know whether you have obeyed the<br/>contract. In principle, the seller could sell a police officer with each book to<br/>follow you around and make sure you use the book as you promised, but the<br/>costs of this control would plainly exceed any benefit.<br/>
But what if each of these rights could be controlled, and each unbundled<br/>
and sold separately? What if, that is, the software itself could regulate whether<br/>you read the book once or one hundred times; whether you could cut and<br/>paste from it or simply read it without copying; whether you could send it as<br/>

178<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
an attached document to a friend or simply keep it on your machine; whether<br/>you could delete it or not; whether you could use it in another work, for<br/>another purpose, or not; or whether you could simply have it on your shelf or<br/>have it and use it as well?<br/>
Stefik describes a network that makes such unbundling of rights possible.<br/>
He describes an architecture that would allow owners of copyrighted materi-<br/>als to sell access to those materials on the terms they want and would enforce<br/>those contracts.<br/>
The details of the system are not important here (it builds on the encryp-<br/>
tion architecture I described in Chapter 4),16 but its general idea is easy<br/>enough to describe. As the Net is now, basic functions like copying and access<br/>are crudely regulated in an all-or-nothing fashion. You generally have the<br/>right to copy or not, to gain access or not.<br/>
But a more sophisticated system of rights could be built into the Net—<br/>
not into a different Net, but on top of the existing Net. This system would<br/>function by discriminating in the intercourse it has with other systems. A<br/>system that controlled access in this more fine-grained way would grant access<br/>to its resources only to another system that controlled access in the same way.<br/>A hierarchy of systems would develop, and copyrighted material would be<br/>traded only among systems that properly controlled access.<br/>
In such a world, then, you could get access, say, to the <i>New York Times </i>and<br/>
pay a different price depending on how much of it you read. The <i>Times </i>could<br/>determine how much you read, whether you could copy portions of the news-<br/>paper, whether you could save it on your hard disk, and so on. But if the code<br/>you used to access the <i>Times </i>site did not enable the control the <i>Times<br/></i>demanded, then the <i>Times </i>would not let you onto its site at all. In short, sys-<br/>tems would exchange information only with others that could be trusted, and<br/>the protocols of trust would be built into the architectures of the systems.<br/>
Stefik calls this “trusted systems,” and the name evokes a helpful analog.<br/>
Think of bonded couriers. Sometimes you want to mail a letter with some-<br/>thing particularly valuable in it. You could simply give it to the post office, but<br/>the post office is not a terribly reliable system; it has relatively little control<br/>over its employees, and theft and loss are not uncommon. So instead of going<br/>to the post office, you could give your letter to a bonded courier. Bonded<br/>couriers are insured, and the insurance is a cost that constrains them to be<br/>reliable. This reputation then makes it possible for senders of valuable mate-<br/>rial to be assured about using their services. As Stefik writes:<br/>
with trusted systems, a substantial part of the enforcement of a digital contract<br/>
is carried out by the trusted system. [T]he consumer does not have the option of<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
179<br/>
disregarding a digital contract by, for example, making unauthorized copies of<br/>
a work. A trusted system refuses to exercise a right that is not sanctioned by the<br/>
digital contract.17<br/>
This is what a structure of trusted systems does for owners of intellectual<br/>
property. It is a bonded courier that takes the thing of value and controls<br/>access to and use of it according to the orders given by the principal.<br/>
Imagine for a moment that such a structure emerged generally in cyber-<br/>
space. How would we then think about copyright law?<br/>
An important point about copyright law is that, though designed in part<br/>
to protect authors, the control it was designed to create was never to be per-<br/>fect. As the Supreme Court noted, copyright “protection has never accorded<br/>the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work.”18<br/>Thus, the law grants only particular exclusive rights, and those rights are sub-<br/>ject to important limitations, such as “fair use,” limited terms, and the first sale<br/>doctrine. The law threatened to punish violators of copyright laws—and it<br/>was this threat that induced a fairly high proportion of people to comply—<br/>but the law was never designed to simply do the author’s bidding. It had pub-<br/>lic purposes as well as the author’s interest in mind.<br/>
Trusted systems provide authors with the same sort of protection.<br/>
Because authors can restrict unauthorized use of their material, they can<br/>extract money in exchange for access. Trusted systems thus achieve what copy-<br/>right law aims to, but they can achieve this protection without the law doing<br/>the restricting. It permits a much more fine-grained control over access to and<br/>use of protected material than the law permits, and it can do so without the<br/>aid of the law.<br/>
What copyright seeks to do using the threat of law and the push of norms,<br/>
trusted systems do through the code. Copyright orders others to respect the<br/>rights of the copyright holder before using his property; trusted systems give<br/>access only if rights are respected in the first place. The controls needed to reg-<br/>ulate this access are built into the systems, and no users (except hackers) have<br/>a choice about whether to obey them. The code complements the law by cod-<br/>ifying the rules, making them more efficient.<br/>
Trusted systems in this sense are a privatized alternative to copyright law.<br/>
They need not be exclusive; there is no reason not to use both law and trusted<br/>systems. Nevertheless, the code is effectively doing the work that the law was<br/>designed to do. It implements the law’s protection, through code, far more<br/>effectively than the law did.<br/>
What could be wrong with this? We do not worry when people put dou-<br/>
ble bolts on their doors to supplement the work of the neighborhood cop. We<br/>

180<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
do not worry when they lock their cars and take their keys. It is not an offense<br/>to protect yourself rather than rely on the state. Indeed, in some contexts it is<br/>a virtue. Andrew Jackson’s mother, for example, told him, “Never tell a lie, nor<br/>take what is not your own, nor sue anybody for slander, assault and battery.<br/>Always settle them cases yourself.”19 Self-sufficiency is strength and going to<br/>the law a sign of weakness.<br/>
There are two steps to answering this question. The first rehearses a famil-<br/>
iar but forgotten point about the nature of “property”; the second makes a less<br/>familiar, but central, point about the nature of intellectual property. Together<br/>they suggest why perfect control is not the control that law has given owners<br/>of intellectual property. And together they suggest the potential problem that<br/>copyright law in cyberspace will create.<br/>
THE LIMITS ON THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY<br/>
The realists in American legal history (circa 1890–1930) were scholars who (in<br/>part) emphasized the role of the state in what was called “private law.”20 At the<br/>time they wrote, it was the “private” in private law that got all the emphasis.<br/>Forgotten was the “law,” as if “property” and “contract” existed independent of<br/>the state.<br/>
The realists’ aim was to undermine this view. Contract and property law,<br/>
they argued, gave private parties power.21 If you breach a contract with me, I<br/>can have the court order the sheriff to force you to pay; the contract gives me<br/>access to the state power of the sheriff. If your contract with your employer<br/>says that it may dismiss you for being late, then the police can be called in to<br/>eject you if you refuse to leave. If your lease forbids you to have cats, then the<br/>landlord can use the power of the courts to evict you if you do not get rid of<br/>the cats. These are all instances where contract and property, however<br/>grounded in private action, give a private person an entitlement to the state.<br/>
No doubt this power is justified in many cases; to call it “law” is not to call<br/>
it unjust. The greatest prosperity in history has been created by a system in<br/>which private parties can order their lives freely through contract and prop-<br/>erty. But whether justified in the main or not, the realists argued that the<br/>contours of this “law” should be architected to benefit society.22<br/>
This is not communism. It is not an attack on private property, and it is<br/>
not to say that the state creates wealth (put your Ayn Rand away). These are<br/>claims about the relationship between private law and public law, and they<br/>should be uncontroversial.<br/>
Private law creates private rights to the extent that these private rights<br/>
serve some collective good. If a private right is harmful to a collective good,<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
181<br/>
then the state has no reason to create it. The state’s interests are general, not<br/>particular. It has a reason to create rights when those rights serve a common,<br/>rather than particular, end.<br/>
The institution of private property is an application of this point. The<br/>
state has an interest in defining rights to private property because private<br/>property helps produce a general, and powerful, prosperity. It is a system for<br/>ordering economic relations that greatly benefits all members of society. No<br/>other system that we have yet devised better orders economic relations. No<br/>other system, some believe, could.23<br/>
But even with ordinary property—your car, or your house—property<br/>
rights are never absolute. There is no property that does not have to yield at<br/>some point to the interests of the state. Your land may be taken to build a<br/>highway, your car seized to carry an accident victim to the hospital, your<br/>driveway crossed by the postman, your house inspected by health inspectors.<br/>In countless ways, the system of property we call “private property” is a system<br/>that balances exclusive control by the individual against certain common state<br/>ends. When the latter conflict with the former, it is the former that yields.<br/>
This balance, the realists argued, is a feature of all property. But it is an<br/>
especially important feature of intellectual property. The balance of rights<br/>with intellectual property differs from the balance with ordinary real or per-<br/>sonal property. “Information,” as Boyle puts it, “is different.”24 And a very<br/>obvious feature of intellectual property shows why.<br/>
When property law gives me the exclusive right to use my house, there’s<br/>
a very good reason for it. If you used my house while I did, I would have less<br/>to use. When the law gives me an exclusive right to my apple, that too makes<br/>sense. If you eat my apple, then I cannot. Your use of my property ordinarily<br/>interferes with my use of my property. Your consumption reduces mine.<br/>
The law has a good reason, then, to give me an exclusive right over my<br/>
personal and real property. If it did not, I would have little reason to work to<br/>produce it. Or if I did work to produce it, I would then spend a great deal of<br/>my time trying to keep you away. It is better for everyone, the argument goes,<br/>if I have an exclusive right to my (rightly acquired) property, because then I<br/>have an incentive to produce it and not waste all my time trying to defend it.25<br/>
Things are different with intellectual property. If you “take” my idea, I still<br/>
have it. If I tell you an idea, you have not deprived me of it.26 An unavoidable<br/>feature of intellectual property is that its consumption, as the economists like<br/>to put it, is “nonrivalrous.” Your consumption does not lessen mine. If I write<br/>a song, you can sing it without making it impossible for me to sing it. If I write<br/>a book, you can read a copy of it (please do) without disabling me from read-<br/>ing another copy of it. Ideas, at their core, can be shared with no reduction in<br/>

182<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
the amount the “owner” can consume. This difference is fundamental, and it<br/>has been understood since the founding.<br/>
Jefferson put it better than I:<br/>
If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive<br/>
property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual<br/>
may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is<br/>
divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot<br/>
dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less,<br/>
because every other possess the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me,<br/>
receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lites his taper at<br/>
mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from<br/>
one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and<br/>
improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently<br/>
designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space,<br/>
without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe,<br/>
move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appro-<br/>
priation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.27<br/>
Technically, Jefferson presents two concepts: One is the possibility of<br/>
excluding others from using or getting access to an idea, which he defines as<br/>“action of the thinking power . . . which an individual may exclusively possess<br/>as long as he keeps it to himself.” This is the question whether ideas are<br/>“excludable”; Jefferson affirms that an idea is “excludable” until “the moment<br/>it is divulged.”<br/>
The other concept is whether my use of a divulged idea lessens your use<br/>
of the same idea. This is the question of whether divulged ideas are “rival-<br/>rous.”28 Again, Jefferson suggests that, once they are divulged, ideas are not<br/>“rivalrous.” Jefferson believes that the act of divulging/sharing has made ideas<br/>both nonexcludable and nonrivalrous, and that there is little that man can do<br/>to change this fact.29<br/>
In fact, shared ideas are both nonexcludable and nonrivalrous. I can<br/>
exclude people from my secret ideas or writings—I can keep them secret, or<br/>build fences to keep people out. How easily, or how effectively, I can do so is<br/>a technical question. It depends on the architecture of protection that a given<br/>context provides. But given the proper technology, there is no doubt that I can<br/>keep people out. What I cannot do is to exclude people from my shared ideas<br/>or writings simply because they are not my secrets anymore.<br/>
My shared ideas are “nonrivalrous” goods, too. No technology (that we<br/>
know of) will erase an idea from your head as it passes into my head. My<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
183<br/>
knowing what you know does not lessen your knowing the same thing. That<br/>fact is a given in the world, and it makes intellectual property different. Unlike<br/>apples, and unlike houses, once shared, ideas are something I can take from<br/>you without diminishing what you have.<br/>
It does not follow, however, that there is no need for property rights over<br/>
expressions or inventions.30 Just because you can have what I have without<br/>lessening what I have does not mean that the state has no reason to create<br/>rights over ideas, or over the expression of ideas.<br/>
If a novelist cannot stop you from copying (rather than buying) her book,<br/>
then she may have very little incentive to produce more books. She may have<br/>as much as she had before you took the work she produced, but if you take it<br/>without paying, she has no monetary incentive to produce more.<br/>
Now, of course, the incentives an author faces are quite complex, and it is<br/>
not possible to make simple generalizations.31 But generalizations do not have<br/>to be perfect to make a point: Even if some authors write for free, it is still the<br/>case that the law needs some intellectual property rights. If the law did not<br/>protect authorship at all, there would be fewer authors. The law has a reason<br/>to protect the rights of authors, at least insofar as doing so gives them an<br/>incentive to produce. With ordinary property, the law must both create an<br/>incentive to produce and protect the right of possession; with intellectual<br/>property, the law need only create the incentive to produce.<br/>
This is the difference between these two very different kinds of property,<br/>
and this difference fundamentally affects the nature of intellectual property<br/>law. While we protect real and personal property to protect the owner from<br/>harm and give the owner an incentive, we protect intellectual property to<br/>ensure that we create a sufficient incentive to produce it. “Sufficient incentive,”<br/>however, is something less than “perfect control.” And in turn we can say that<br/>the ideal protections of intellectual property law are something less than the<br/>ideal protections for ordinary or real property.<br/>
This difference between the nature of intellectual property and ordinary<br/>
property was recognized by our Constitution, which in article I, section 8,<br/>clause 8, gives Congress the power “to promote the Progress of Science and<br/>useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclu-<br/>sive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”<br/>
Note the special structure of this clause. First, it sets forth the precise rea-<br/>
son for the power—to promote the progress of science and useful arts. It is for<br/>those reasons, and those reasons only, that Congress may grant an exclusive<br/>right. And second, note the special temporality of this right: “for limited<br/>Times.” The Constitution does not allow Congress to grant authors and<br/>inventors permanent exclusive rights to their writings and discoveries, only<br/>

184<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
limited rights. (Though apparently those limited times can be extended.32) It<br/>does not give Congress the power to give them a perpetual “property” in their<br/>writings and discoveries, only an exclusive right over them for a limited time.<br/>
The Constitution’s protection for intellectual property then is fundamen-<br/>
tally different from its protection of ordinary property. I’ve said that all prop-<br/>erty is granted subject to the limit of the public good. But even so, if the<br/>government decided to nationalize all property after a fifteen-year term of<br/>ownership, the Constitution would require it to compensate the owners. By<br/>contrast, if Congress set the copyright term at fifteen years, there would be no<br/>claim that the government pay compensation after the fifteen years were up.<br/>Intellectual property rights are a monopoly that the state gives to producers of<br/>intellectual property in exchange for their production of it. After a limited<br/>time, the product of their work becomes the public’s to use as it wants. This<br/>is Communism at the core of our Constitution’s protection of intellectual<br/>property. This “property” is not property in the ordinary sense of that term.<br/>
And this is true for reasons better than tradition as well. Economists have<br/>
long understood that granting property rights over information is dangerous<br/>(to say the least).33 This is not because of leftist leanings among economists;<br/>it is because economists are consequentialists, and their objective in granting<br/>any property right is simply to facilitate production. But there is no way to<br/>know, in principle, whether increasing or decreasing the rights granted under<br/>intellectual property law will lead to an increase in the production of intellec-<br/>tual property. The reasons are complex, but the point is not: Increasing intel-<br/>lectual property’s protection is not guaranteed to “promote the progress of<br/>science and useful arts”—indeed, often doing so will stifle it.<br/>
The balance that intellectual property law traditionally strikes is between<br/>
the protections granted the author and the public use or access granted every-<br/>one else. The aim is to give the author sufficient incentive to produce. Built<br/>into the law of intellectual property are limits on the power of the author to<br/>control use of the ideas she has created.34<br/>
A classic example of these limits and of this public use dimension is the<br/>
right of “fair use.” Fair use is the right to use copyrighted material, regardless<br/>of the wishes of the owner of that material. A copyright gives the owner cer-<br/>tain rights; fair use is a limitation on those rights. It gives you the right to crit-<br/>icize this book, cut sections from it, and reproduce them in an article<br/>attacking me. In these ways and in others, you have the right to use this book<br/>independent of how I say it should be used.<br/>
Fair use does not necessarily work against the author’s interest—or more<br/>
accurately, fair use does not necessarily work against the interests of authors as<br/>a class. When fair use protects the right of reviewers to criticize books without<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
185<br/>
the permission of authors, then more critics criticize. And the more criticism<br/>there is, the better the information is about what books people should buy. The<br/>better the information is about what to buy, the more people will buy it.<br/>Authors as a whole benefit from the system of fair use, even if particular<br/>authors do not.<br/>
The law of copyright is filled with such rules. Another is the “first sale”<br/>
doctrine. If you buy this book, you can sell it to someone else free of any con-<br/>straint I might impose on you.35 This doctrine differs from the tradition in, for<br/>example, Europe, where there are “moral rights” that give the creator power<br/>over subsequent use.36 I’ve already mentioned another example—limited<br/>term. The creator cannot extend the term for which the law will provide pro-<br/>tection (even if Congress can); that is fixed by the statute and runs out when<br/>the statute runs out.<br/>
Taken together, these rules give the creator significant—but not perfect—<br/>
control over the use of what he produces. They give the public some access,<br/>but not complete access. They are balanced differently from the balance the<br/>law strikes for ordinary property—by design. They are constitutionally struc-<br/>tured to help build an intellectual and cultural commons.<br/>
The law strikes this balance. It is not a balance that would exist in nature.<br/>
Without the law, and before cyberspace, authors would have very little protec-<br/>tion; with the law, they have significant, but not perfect, protection. The law<br/>gives authors something they otherwise would not have in exchange for limits<br/>on their rights, secured to benefit the intellectual commons as a whole.<br/>
PRIVATE SUBSTITUTES FOR PUBLIC LAW<br/>
So copyright law strikes a balance between control and access. What about<br/>that balance when code is the law? Should we expect that any of the limits will<br/>remain? Should we expect code to mirror the limits that the law imposes?<br/>Fair use? Limited term? Would private code build these “bugs” into its protec-<br/>tions?<br/>
The point should be obvious: When intellectual property is protected by<br/>
code, nothing requires that the same balance be struck. Nothing requires the<br/>owner to grant the right of fair use. She might allow individuals to browse for<br/>free, as a bookstore does, but she might not. Whether she grants this right<br/>depends on whether it profits her. Fair use becomes contingent upon private<br/>gain. More importantly, it becomes contingent upon the private gain of<br/>authors individually rather than authors as a class.<br/>
Thus, as privatized law, trusted systems regulate in the same domain that<br/>
copyright law regulates. But unlike copyright law, they do not guarantee the<br/>

186<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
same limits on copyright’s protection. Trusted systems give the producer max-<br/>imum control over the uses of copyrighted work—admittedly at a cheaper<br/>cost, thus perhaps permitting many more authors to publish. But they give<br/>authors almost perfect control in an area in which the law did not. Code thus<br/>displaces the balance that copyright law strikes by displacing the limits the law<br/>imposes. As Daniel Benloliel puts it,<br/>
[D]ecentralized content providers are . . . privatizing the enforcement authority<br/>
with strict technological standards, under which individuals would be banned<br/>
from access and use of particular digital content in a way that might override<br/>
legitimate fair use.37<br/>
So far my description simply sets law against code: the law of copyright<br/>
either complemented by, or in conflict with, private code. You may not yet<br/>be convinced that we should consider this a conflict, because it has always<br/>been the case that one can exercise more control over a copyrighted work<br/>than the law gives you the right to exercise over the copyright. For example,<br/>if you own a painting that is in the public domain, there’s no requirement<br/>for you to let anyone see it. You could lock it in your bedroom and never let<br/>anyone see it ever. In a sense, you’ve thus deprived the world of the value of<br/>this painting being in the “public domain.” But no one has ever thought<br/>that this interaction between the law of trespass and copyright has created<br/>any important conflict. So why should anyone be troubled if copyright own-<br/>ers use code to lock up their content beyond the balance the law of copy-<br/>right strikes?<br/>
If this is where you’re stuck, then let me add one more part to the story.<br/>
As I mentioned above, the DMCA contains an anti-circumvention provision.<br/>That part of the law forbids the circumvention of some technical protection<br/>measures; it forbids the development of tools to circumvent technical protec-<br/>tion as well. Most important, it forbids these circumventions regardless of<br/>the purpose of the circumvention. Thus, if the underlying use you would<br/>make of a copyrighted work—if you could get access to it—is a “fair use,” the<br/>DMCA still makes it an offense to circumvent technical protections to get<br/>access to it. Thus one part of the law of copyright grants “fair use,” while<br/>another part of copyright removes at least some fair use liberty where the<br/>fair use has been removed by technical means.38<br/>
But so what, the skeptic will ask. What the law gives, the law can take<br/>
away, can’t it?<br/>
No it can’t, and that’s the point. As the Supreme Court has indicated,<br/>
copyright law is consistent with the First Amendment only because of certain<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
187<br/>
important limitations built into the law. Removing those limitations would<br/>then raise important First Amendment questions. Thus, when the law acts<br/>with code to remove the law’s protection for fair use, this should raise an<br/>important question—at least for those concerned about maintaining the bal-<br/>ance that copyright law strikes.<br/>
But maybe this conflict is just temporary. Couldn’t the code be changed<br/>
to protect fair use?<br/>
The answer to that hopeful (and again, hopeful because my main point is<br/>
about whether incentives to protect fair use exist) question is no, not directly.<br/>Fair use inherently requires a judgment about purpose, or intent. That judg-<br/>ment is beyond the ken of even the best computers. Indirectly, however, fair<br/>use could be protected. A system that allowed an individual to unlock the<br/>trusted system if he claimed the use was fair (perhaps marking the used work<br/>with a tag to make it possible to trace the use back to the user) could protect<br/>fair use. Or as Stefik describes, a system that granted users a “fair use license,”<br/>allowing them to unlock the content and use insurance backing the license to<br/>pay for any misuse, might also protect fair use.39 But these alternatives again<br/>rely on structures beyond code. With the code itself, there is no way ade-<br/>quately to police fair use.<br/>
Some will respond that I am late to the party: Copyright law is already<br/>
being displaced, if not by code then by the private law of contract. Through<br/>the use of click-wrap, or shrink-wrap, licenses, authors are increasingly<br/>demanding that purchasers, or licensees, waive rights that copyright law gave<br/>them. If copyright law gives the right to reverse-engineer, then these contracts<br/>might extract a promise not to reverse-engineer. If copyright law gives the<br/>right to dispose of the book however the purchaser wants after the first sale,<br/>then a contract might require that the user waive that right. And if these<br/>terms in the contract attached to every copyright work are enforceable merely<br/>by being “attached” and “knowable,” then already we have the ability through<br/>contract law to rewrite the balance that copyright law creates.<br/>
I agree that this race to privatize copyright law through contract is already<br/>
far along, fueled in particular by decisions such as Judge Frank Easterbrook’s<br/>in <i>ProCD v. Zeidenberg</i>. But contracts are not as bad as code. Contracts are a<br/>form of law. If a term of a contract is inconsistent with a value of copyright<br/>law, you can refuse to obey it and let the other side get a court to enforce it. In<br/>some cases, courts have expressly refused to follow a contract term precisely<br/>because it is inconsistent with a copyright law value.40 The ultimate power of<br/>a contract depends upon the decision by a court to enforce the contract or<br/>not. Although courts today are relatively eager to find ways to enforce these<br/>contracts, there is at least hope that if the other side makes its case very clear,<br/>

188<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
courts could shift direction again.41 As Stefik writes, trusted systems “differ<br/>from an ordinary contract in critical ways.”<br/>
[I]n an ordinary contract, compliance is not automatic; it is the responsibility of<br/>
the agreeing parties. There may be provisions for monitoring and checking on<br/>
compliance, but the actual responsibility for acting in accordance with the terms<br/>
falls on the parties. In addition, enforcement of the contract is ultimately the<br/>
province of the courts.42<br/>
The same is not true of code. Whatever problems there are when con-<br/>
tracts replace copyright law, the problems are worse when code displaces<br/>copyright law. Again—where do we challenge the code? When the software<br/>protects without relying in the end on the state, where can we challenge the<br/>nature of the protection? Where can we demand balance when the code takes<br/>it away?<br/>
I don’t mean to enter the extremely contentious debate about whether<br/>
this change in control is good or appropriate. I’ve said too much about that<br/>elsewhere.43 For our purposes here, the point is simply to recognize a signifi-<br/>cant change. Code now makes possible increasingly perfect control over how<br/>culture is spread. Regulations have “been fairly consistent . . . on the side of<br/>expanding the power of the owners to control the use of their products.”44<br/>And these regulations invite a demand for perfect control over how culture is<br/>spread.<br/>
The rise of contracts qualifying copyright law and the rise of code quali-<br/>
fying copyright law raise a question that the law of copyright has not had to<br/>answer before. We have never had to choose whether authors should be per-<br/>mitted perfectly to control the use of their intellectual property independent<br/>of the law, for such control was not possible. The balance struck by the law<br/>was the best that authors could get. But now, code gives authors a better deal.<br/>The question for legal policy is whether this better deal makes public sense.<br/>
Here we confront the first latent ambiguity within the law of copyright.<br/>
There are those who would say that copyright law already decides this ques-<br/>tion—whether against code-based control, or for it. But in my view, this is a<br/>choice the law has yet to make. I have my own views about how the law should<br/>decide the question. But what technology has done is force us to see a choice<br/>that was not made before. See the choice, and then make it.<br/>
Put most directly: There has always been a set of uses of copyrighted<br/>
work that was unregulated by the law of copyright. Even within the boundary<br/>of uses that were regulated by the law of copyright, “fair use” kept some uses<br/>free. The core question is why? Were these transactions left free because it<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
189<br/>
was too costly to meter them? Or were these transactions left free because<br/>keeping them free was an important public value tied to copyright?<br/>
This is a question the law never had to resolve, though there is support for<br/>
both views.45 Now the technology forces us to resolve it. The question, then,<br/>is how.<br/>
A nice parallel to this problem exists in one part of constitutional law. The<br/>
framers gave Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce and com-<br/>merce that affects interstate commerce.46 At the founding, that was a lot of<br/>commerce, but because of the inefficiencies of the market, not all of it. Thus,<br/>the states had a domain of commerce that they alone could regulate.47<br/>
Over time, however, the scope of interstate commerce has changed so<br/>
that much less commerce is now within the exclusive domain of the states.<br/>This change has produced two sorts of responses. One is to find other ways to<br/>give states domains of exclusive regulatory authority. The justification for<br/>this response is the claim that these changes in interstate commerce are<br/>destroying the framers’ vision about state power.<br/>
The other response is to concede the increasing scope of federal authority,<br/>
but to deny that it is inconsistent with the framing balance.48 Certainly, at the<br/>founding, some commerce was not interstate and did not affect interstate<br/>commerce. But that does not mean that the framers intended that there must<br/>always be such a space. They tied the scope of federal power to a moving tar-<br/>get; if the target moves completely to the side of federal power, then that is<br/>what we should embrace.49<br/>
In both contexts, the change is the same. We start in a place where balance<br/>
is given to us by the mix of frictions within a particular regulatory domain:<br/>Fair use is a balance given to us because it is too expensive to meter all use;<br/>state power over commerce is given to us because not all commerce affects<br/>interstate commerce. When new technology disturbs the balance, we must<br/>decide whether the original intent was that there be a balance, or that the<br/>scope of one side of each balance should faithfully track the index to which it<br/>was originally tied. Both contexts, in short, present ambiguity.<br/>
Many observers (myself included) have strong feelings one way or the<br/>
other. We believe this latent ambiguity is not an ambiguity at all. In the con-<br/>text of federal power, we believe either that the states were meant to keep a<br/>domain of exclusive authority50 or that the federal government was to have<br/>whatever power affected interstate commerce.51 In the context of fair use, we<br/>believe that either fair use is to be a minimum of public use, guaranteed<br/>regardless of the technology,52 or that it is just an efficient compromise in<br/>response to an inefficient technology, to be removed as soon as efficiency can<br/>be achieved.<br/>

190<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
But in both cases, this may make the problem too easy. The best answer in<br/>
both contexts may be that the question was unresolved at the framing: Per-<br/>haps no one thought of the matter, and hence there is no answer to the ques-<br/>tion of what they would have intended if some central presupposition had<br/>changed. And if there was no original answer, we must decide the question by<br/>our own lights. As Stefik says of trusted systems—and, we might expect, of the<br/>implications of trusted systems—“It is a tool never imagined by the creators<br/>of copyright law, or by those who believe laws governing intellectual property<br/>cannot be enforced.”53<br/>
The loss of fair use is a consequence of the perfection of trusted systems.<br/>
Whether you consider it a problem or not depends on your view of the value<br/>of fair use. If you consider it a public value that should exist regardless of the<br/>technological regime, then the emergence of this perfection should trouble<br/>you. From your perspective, there was a value latent in the imperfection of the<br/>old system that has now been erased.<br/>
But even if you do not think that the loss of fair use is a problem, trusted<br/>
systems threaten other values latent in the imperfection of the real world.<br/>Consider a second.<br/>
THE ANONYMITY THAT IMPERFECTION ALLOWS<br/>
I was a student at an English university for a number of years. In the college<br/>I attended, there was a “buttery”—a shop inside the college that basically sold<br/>alcohol. During the first week I was there I had to buy a large amount of<br/>Scotch (a series of unimaginative gifts, as I remember). About a week after I<br/>made these purchases, I received a summons from my tutor to come talk with<br/>him in his office. When I arrived, the tutor asked me about my purchases. This<br/>was, to his mind, an excessive amount of alcohol, and he wanted to know<br/>whether I had a good reason for buying it.<br/>
Needless to say, I was shocked at the question. Of course, technically, I had<br/>
made a purchase at the college, and I had not hidden my name when I did so<br/>(indeed, I had charged it on my college account), so, formally, I had revealed my<br/>alcohol purchases to the college and its agents. Still, it shocked me that this infor-<br/>mation would be monitored by college authorities and then checked up on. I<br/>could see why they did it, and I could see the good that might come from it. It just<br/>never would have occurred to me that these data would be used in this way.<br/>
If this was an invasion, of course, it was a small one. Later it was easy for<br/>
me to hide my binges simply by buying from a local store rather than the<br/>college buttery. (Though I later learned that the local store rented its space<br/>from the college, so who knows what deal they had struck?) And in any case,<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
191<br/>
I was not being punished. The college was just concerned. But the example<br/>suggests a more general point: We reveal to the world a certain class of data<br/>about ourselves that we ordinarily expect the world not to use. What happens<br/>when they use it?<br/>
Trusted systems depend on such data—they depend on the ability to<br/>
know how people use the property that is being protected. To set prices most<br/>efficiently, the system ideally should know as much about individuals and<br/>their reading habits as possible. It needs to know this data because it needs an<br/>efficient way to track use and so to charge for it.54<br/>
But this tracking involves a certain invasion. We live now in a world where<br/>
we think about what we read in just the way that I thought about what I<br/>bought as a student in England—we do not expect that anyone is keeping<br/>track. We would be shocked if we learned that the library was keeping tabs on<br/>the books that people checked out and then using this data in some monitor-<br/>ing way.<br/>
Such tracking, however, is just what trusted systems require. And so the<br/>
question becomes: Should there be a right against this kind of monitoring?<br/>The question is parallel to the question of fair use. In a world where this mon-<br/>itoring could not effectively occur, there was, of course, no such right against<br/>it. But now that monitoring can occur, we must ask whether the latent right<br/>to read anonymously, given to us before by imperfections in technologies,<br/>should be a legally protected right.<br/>
Julie Cohen argues that it should, and we can see quite directly how her<br/>
argument proceeds.55 Whatever its source, it is a value in this world that we<br/>can explore intellectually on our own. It is a value that we can read anony-<br/>mously, without fear that others will know or watch or change their behavior<br/>based on what we read. This is an element of intellectual freedom; it is a part<br/>of what makes us as we are.56<br/>
But this element is potentially erased by trusted systems. These systems<br/>
need to monitor, and this monitoring destroys anonymity. We need to decide<br/>whether, and how, to preserve values from today in a context of trusted systems.<br/>
This could first be a question of translation: namely, how should changes<br/>
in technology be accommodated to preserve values from an earlier context in<br/>a new context? It is the same question that Brandeis asked about wiretap-<br/>ping.57 It is the question the Court answers in scores of contexts all the time.<br/>It is fundamentally a question about preserving values when contexts change.<br/>
In the context of both fair use and reading, Cohen has a consistent answer<br/>
to this question of translation. She argues that there is a right to resist, or<br/>“hack,” trusted systems to the extent that they infringe on traditional fair use.<br/>(Others have called this the “Cohen Theorem.”) As for reading, she argues that<br/>

192<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
copyright management schemes must protect a right to read anonymously—<br/>that if they monitor, they must be constructed so that they preserve<br/>anonymity. The strategy is the same: Cohen identifies a value yielded by an<br/>old architecture but now threatened by a new architecture, and then argues in<br/>favor of an affirmative right to protect the original value.<br/>
But here again we might view the question more ambiguously. I share<br/>
Cohen’s view, but the argument on the other side is not silly. If it’s permissible<br/>to use technology to make copyrighted works available, why isn’t it permissi-<br/>ble to gather data about who uses what works? That data gathering is not<br/>part of the copyright itself; it is a byproduct of the technology. And as our tra-<br/>dition has never had this technical capacity before, it is hard to say a choice<br/>was made about it in the past.<br/>
PERMISSION CULTURE VS. FREE<br/>
I’ve already described the limits copyright law places on itself. These limits, as<br/>I argued, reflect important values. They express the balance that copyright law<br/>aims to be.<br/>
But what is too often missed in this discussion of balance is any sense of<br/>
perspective. We focus on the gradual shifts in the law but miss the profound<br/>sense in which the significance of the law has changed.<br/>
This change is produced by the unintended interaction between the archi-<br/>
tecture of digital technologies and the architecture of the law.<br/>
Copyright law at its core regulates “copies.” In the analog world, there<br/>
were very few contexts in which one produced “copies.” As Jessica Litman<br/>described more than a decade ago,<br/>
At the turn of the century, U.S. copyright law was technical, inconsistent, and<br/>
difficult to understand, but it didn’t apply to very many people or very many<br/>
things. If one were an author or publisher of books, maps, charts, paintings,<br/>
sculpture, photographs or sheet music, a playwright or producer of plays, or a<br/>
printer, the copyright law bore on one’s business. Booksellers, piano-roll and<br/>
phonograph record publishers, motion picture producers, musicians, scholars,<br/>
members of Congress, and ordinary consumers could go about their business<br/>
without ever encountering a copyright problem.58<br/>
Thus there were many ways in which you could use creative work in the<br/>
analog world without producing a copy.<br/>
Digital technology, at its core, makes copies. Copies are to digital life as<br/>
breathing is to our physical life. There is no way to use any content in a digital<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
193<br/>
context without that use producing a copy. When you read a book stored on<br/>your computer, you make a copy (at least in the RAM memory to page<br/>through the book). When you do anything with digital content, you techni-<br/>cally produce a copy.<br/>
This technical fact about digital technologies, tied to the technical archi-<br/>
tecture of the law, produces a profound shift in the scope or reach of the law<br/>of copyright that too many simply miss: While in the analog world, life was<br/>sans copyright law; in the digital world, life is subject to copyright law. Every<br/>single act triggers the law of copyright. Every single use is either subject to a<br/>license or illegal, unless deemed to be “fair use.” The emergence of digital<br/>technologies has thus radically increased the domain of copyright law—from<br/>regulating a tiny portion of human life, to regulating absolutely every bit of<br/>life on a computer.<br/>
Now if all you think about is protecting the distribution of professionally<br/>
created culture, this might not concern you much. If you’re trying to stop<br/>“piracy,” then a regime that says every use requires permission is a regime<br/>that gives you a fairly broad range of tools for stamping out piracy.<br/>
But though you wouldn’t notice this listening to the debates surround-<br/>
ing copyright law just now, in fact, protecting the distribution of profes-<br/>sionally created culture is not the only, or even, I suggest, the most<br/>important part of culture. And indeed, from a historical perspective, top-<br/>down, professionally produced culture is but a tiny part of what makes<br/>any culture sing. The 20th century may have been an exception to this rule,<br/>but no Congress voted to make professional culture the only legal culture<br/>within our society.<br/>
Standing alongside professional culture is amateur culture—where ama-<br/>
teur doesn’t mean inferior or without talent, but instead culture created by<br/>people who produce not for the money, but for the love of what they do.<br/>From this perspective, there is amateur culture everywhere—from your din-<br/>ner table, where your father or sister tell jokes that take off from the latest<br/>political scandal or the latest <i>Daily Show; </i>from your basement, where your<br/>brother and his three best friends are causing permanent damage to their<br/>eardrums as they try to become the next Rolling Stones; from your neighbors<br/>who gather each Thursday and Sunday to sing in a church choir; from your<br/>neighborhood schools, where kids and teachers create art or music in the<br/>course of learning about our culture; from the kids at your neighborhood<br/>school, who tear their pants or wear their shirts in some odd way, all as a way<br/>to express and make culture.<br/>
This amateur culture has always been with us, even if it is to us today, as<br/>
Dan Hunter and Greg Lastowska put it, “hidden.”59 It is precisely how the<br/>

194<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
imagination of kids develops;60 it is how culture has always developed. As<br/>Siva Vaidhyanathan writes,<br/>
widespread democratic cultural production (peer-to-peer production, one<br/>
might say) . . . merely echoes how cultural texts have flowed through and been<br/>
revised by discursive communities everywhere for centuries. Texts often undergo<br/>
a process similar to a game of “telephone,” through which a text is substan-<br/>
tially—sometimes almost unintentionally—distorted through many small revi-<br/>
sions. . . . Such radical textual revisions have occurred in other contexts and<br/>
have helped build political critiques, if not movements. For instance, historian<br/>
Lawrence Levine (1988) has documented how working-class players and audi-<br/>
ences in nineteenth-century America adapted and revised the works of William<br/>
Shakespeare to their local contexts, concerns and ideologies. And historian Eric<br/>
Lott (1993) has shown how <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin </i>was reworked by working-class<br/>
white communities to aid the cause of racial dominance instead of the Christian<br/>
liberationist message the book was intended to serve.61<br/>
Importantly, too, this kind of cultural remix has historically been free of<br/>
regulation. No one would think that as you tell a joke around your dinner<br/>table, or sing songs with your friends, or practice to become the next Rolling<br/>Stones, you need a lawyer standing next to you, clearing the rights to “use” the<br/>culture as you make your creative remix. The law of copyright, historically, has<br/>been focused on commercial life. It has left the noncommercial, or beyond<br/>commercial, creativity free of legal regulation.<br/>
All this has now changed, and digital technologies are responsible. First,<br/>
and most important, digital technologies have radically expanded the scope of<br/>this amateur culture. Now the clever remix of some political event or the<br/>latest song by your favorite band are not just something you can share with<br/>your friends. Digital technologies have made it simple to capture and share<br/>this creativity with the world. The single most important difference between<br/>the Internet circa 1999 and the Internet circa today is the explosion of user-<br/>generated creativity—from blogs, to podcasts, to videocasts, to mashups, the<br/>Internet today is a space of extraordinary creativity.<br/>
Second, digital technologies have democratized creativity. Technology<br/>
has given a wide range of potential creators the capacity to become real. “Peo-<br/>ple are waking from their consumerist coma,” one commentator describes.62<br/>As DJ Danger Mouse put it at the Web 2.0 conference in 2004,<br/>
Mashing is so easy. It takes years to learn how to play the guitar and write your<br/>
own songs. It takes a few weeks of practice with a turntable to make people<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
195<br/>
dance and smile. It takes a few hours to crank out something good with some<br/>
software. So with such a low barrier to entry, everyone jumps in and starts<br/>
immediately being creative.63<br/>
But third, and directly relevant to the story of this chapter, to the extent<br/>
this creativity finds its expression on the Net, it is now subject to the regula-<br/>tion of copyright law. To the extent it uses others’ creativity, it needs the per-<br/>mission of others. To the extent it builds upon the creativity of others, it needs<br/>to be sure that that creativity can be built upon legally. A whole system of reg-<br/>ulation has now been grafted upon an economy of creativity that until now<br/>has never known regulation. Amateur culture, or bottom up culture, or the<br/>culture that lives outside of commercial transactions—all of this is subject to<br/>regulation in a way that 30 years ago it was not.<br/>
A recent example of this conflict makes the point very concisely. There’s<br/>
a genre of digital creativity called Anime Music Videos (AMVs). AMVs are<br/>remixes of anime cartoons and music. Kids spend hundreds, sometimes thou-<br/>sands of hours reediting the anime cartoons to match them perfectly to music.<br/>The result is, in a word, extraordinary. It is among the most creative uses of<br/>digital technology that I have seen.<br/>
While this genre of creativity is not small, it’s also not huge. Basically one<br/>
site dominates activity around AMVs. That site has more than 500,000 mem-<br/>bers, and some 30,000 creators upload AMV content to the site.<br/>
In November 2005, one prominent record label, Wind-Up Records,<br/>
informed this website that it wanted all Wind-Up Records artists removed<br/>from the site. That was some 3,000 videos, representing at least 250,000 hours<br/>of volunteer work by creators across the world—work that would have just<br/>one real effect: to promote the underlying artists’ work.<br/>
From the perspective of the law as it is, this is an easy case. What the kids<br/>
are doing is making a derivative work of the anime; they are distributing full<br/>copies of the underlying music; and they are synchronizing the music to<br/>video—all without the permission of the copyright owners.<br/>
But from the perspective of culture, this should be a very hard case.<br/>
The creativity demonstrated by this work is extraordinary. I can’t show<br/>you that creativity in a book, but the notes point you to an example that<br/>you can see.64 It is noncommercial, amateur creative work—precisely the<br/>sort that has never been subject to the regulation of the law, but which<br/>now, because it is living in digital context, is monitored, and regulated, by<br/>the law.<br/>
Here again, I have strong feelings about what the right answer should be.<br/>
But we should recognize the latent ambiguity this conflict presents:<br/>

196<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Because of the changes in digital technology, it is now possible for the law<br/>
to regulate every single use of creative work in a digital environment. As life<br/>increasingly moves into a digital environment, this means that the law will<br/>regulate more and more of the use of culture.<br/>
Is this consistent with our values?<br/>The answer again could be found first by trying to translate framing val-<br/>
ues into the current context. From that perspective, it would be extraordinar-<br/>ily difficult to imagine that the framing vision would have included the level<br/>of legal regulation that the current regime entails.<br/>
Again, that conclusion could be questioned by recognizing that the pos-<br/>
sibility of such extensive regulation didn’t exist, and so the choice about<br/>whether such extensive regulation should be allowed wasn’t made. That<br/>choice, when made, should recognize that while there is extensive and new<br/>regulation of amateur culture, that regulation creates new wealth for profes-<br/>sional culture. There’s a choice to be made about which form of culture we<br/>should protect. That choice has not yet been made directly. It is one more<br/>choice we have yet to make.<br/>
THE PROBLEMS THAT PERFECTION MAKES<br/>
These three examples reveal a common pattern—one that will reach far<br/>beyond copyright. At one time we enjoyed a certain kind of liberty. But that<br/>liberty was not directly chosen; it was a liberty resulting from the high costs of<br/>control.65 That was the conclusion we drew about fair use—that when the cost<br/>of control was high, the space for fair use was great. So too with anonymous<br/>reading: We read anonymously in real space not so much because laws protect<br/>that right as because the cost of tracking what we read is so great. And it was<br/>the same with amateur culture: That flourished free of regulation because<br/>regulation could not easily reach it.<br/>
When costs of control fall, however, liberty is threatened. That threat<br/>
requires a choice—do we allow the erosion of an earlier liberty, or do we erect<br/>other limits to re-create that original liberty?<br/>
The law of intellectual property is the first example of this general point.<br/>
As the architecture of the Internet changes, it will allow for a greater protec-<br/>tion of intellectual property than real-space architectures allowed; this<br/>greater protection will force a choice on us that we do not need to make in<br/>real space. Should the architecture allow perfect control over intellectual<br/>property, or should we build into the architecture an incompleteness that<br/>guarantees a certain aspect of public use or a certain space for individual<br/>freedom?<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
197<br/>
Ignoring these questions will not make them go away. Pretending that the<br/>
framers answered them is no solution either. In this context (and this is just<br/>the first) we will need to make a judgment about which values the architecture<br/>will protect.<br/>
CHOICES<br/>
I’ve argued that cyberspace will open up three important choices in the context<br/>of intellectual property: whether to allow intellectual property in effect to<br/>become completely propertized (for that is what a perfect code regime for pro-<br/>tecting intellectual property would do); and whether to allow this regime to<br/>erase the anonymity latent in less efficient architectures of control; and whether<br/>to allow the expansion of intellectual property to drive out amateur culture.<br/>These choices were not made by our framers. They are for us to make now.<br/>
I have a view, in this context as in the following three, about how we<br/>
should exercise that choice. But I am a lawyer. Lawyers are taught to point<br/>elsewhere—to the framers, to the United Nations charter, to an act of Con-<br/>gress—when arguing about how things ought to be. Having said that there is<br/>no such authority here, I feel as if I ought to be silent.<br/>
Cowardly, not silent, however, is how others might see it. They say that I<br/>
should say what I think. So in each of these three applications (intellectual<br/>property, privacy, and free speech), I will offer my view about how these<br/>choices should be made. But I do this under some duress and encourage you<br/>to simply ignore what I believe. It will be short, and summary, and easy to dis-<br/>card. It is the balance of the book—and, most importantly, the claim that we<br/>have a choice to make—that I really want to stick.<br/>
Anonymity<br/>
Cohen, it seems to me, is plainly right about anonymity, and the Cohen The-<br/>orem is inspirational. However efficient the alternative may be, we should<br/>certainly architect cyberspaces to ensure anonymity—or more precisely, pseu-<br/>donymity—first. If the code is going to monitor what I do, then at least it<br/>should not know that it is “I” that it is monitoring. I am less troubled if it<br/>knows that “14AH342BD7” read such and such; I am deeply troubled if that<br/>number is tied back to my name.<br/>
Cohen is right for a second reason as well: All of the good that comes<br/>
from monitoring could be achieved while protecting privacy. It may take a bit<br/>more coding to build in routines for breaking traceability; it may take more<br/>planning to ensure that privacy is protected. But if those rules are embedded<br/>

198<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
up front, the cost would not be terribly high. It is far cheaper to architect pri-<br/>vacy protections now rather than retrofit for them later.<br/>
The Commons<br/>
By “the Commons” I mean a resource that anyone within a relevant commu-<br/>nity can use without seeking the permission of anyone else. Such permission<br/>may not be required because the resource is not subject to any legal control (it<br/>is, in other words, in the public domain). Or it may not be required because<br/>permission to use the resource has already been granted. In either case, to<br/>use or to build upon this resource requires nothing more than access to the<br/>resource itself.66<br/>
In this sense, the questions about the scope and reach of copyright law ask<br/>
whether our future will protect the intellectual commons that it did in the<br/>past. Again, it did so in the past because the friction of control was too great.<br/>But now that that friction is gone, will we preserve or destroy the commons<br/>that used to exist?<br/>
My view is that it ought to be preserved.<br/>We can architect cyberspace to preserve a commons or not. (Jefferson<br/>
thought that nature had already done the architecting, but Jefferson wrote<br/>before there was code.) We should choose to architect it with a commons. Our<br/>past had a commons that could not be designed away; that commons gave our<br/>culture great value. What value the commons of the future could bring us is<br/>something we are just beginning to see. Intellectual property scholars saw<br/>it—long before cyberspace came along—and laid the groundwork for much<br/>of the argument we need to have now.67 The greatest work in the law of cyber-<br/>space has been written in the field of intellectual property. In a wide range of<br/>contexts, these scholars have made a powerful case for the substantive value of<br/>an intellectual commons.68<br/>
James Boyle puts the case most dramatically in his extraordinary book<br/>
<i>Shamans, Software, and Spleens</i>.69 Drawing together both cyberspace and non-<br/>cyberspace questions, he spells out the challenge we face in an information<br/>society—particularly the political challenge.70 Elsewhere he identifies our<br/>need for an “environmental movement” in information policy—a rhetoric<br/>that gets people to see the broad range of values put at risk by this movement<br/>to propertize all information. Boyle’s work has inspired many others to push<br/>a similar agenda of freedom.71<br/>
That freedom would limit the law’s regulation over the use and reuse of<br/>
culture. It would resist perfect control over use; it would free a wide range of<br/>reuse. It would build through affirmative protections for freedom the liberty<br/>

intellectual property<br/>
199<br/>
that friction gave us before. It would do so because it believes in the values this<br/>freedom stands for, and it would demonstrate the value in that freedom by<br/>enabling the communities that freedom would itself enable.<br/>
But this freedom could be constructed either through changes in the law<br/>
or voluntarily. That is, the law could be rebalanced to encourage the freedom<br/>thought important, or this property could be redeployed to effect the freedom<br/>thought important.<br/>
The second strategy was the technique of the Free Software Movement,<br/>
described in Chapter 8. Using copyright law, Stallman deployed a software<br/>license that both preserved the four freedoms of free software, and also<br/>required that those modifying and distributing free software distribute the<br/>modifications freely. This license thus effects a software commons, since the<br/>software is available to all to use, and this software commons has become a<br/>critical raw material fueling the digital age.<br/>
More recently, Stallman’s idea has been copied by others seeking to<br/>
rebuild a commons in cyberspace. The Wikipedia project, for example, has<br/>built—to the astonishment of most—an extraordinary online encyclopedia<br/>solely through the volunteer efforts of thousands, contributing essays and<br/>edits in a public wiki. The product of that work is now protected perpetually<br/>(yes, I know, only for a “limited time,” but don’t correct <i>me </i>about that little<br/>detail) through a copyright license that, like the GPL, requires any modifica-<br/>tion to be distributed freely as well. (More on Wikipedia in Chapter 12.)<br/>
And so too has Creative Commons used private law to build an effective<br/>
public commons. Again, following Stallman, Creative Commons offers copy-<br/>right holders a simple way to mark their creative work with the freedoms<br/>they intend it to carry. That mark is a license which reserves to the author<br/>some rights, while dedicating to the public rights that otherwise would have<br/>been held privately. As these licenses are nonexclusive and public, they too<br/>effectively build a commons of creative resources that anyone can build upon.<br/>
Though I have spent a great deal of my time helping to build the Creative<br/>
Commons, I still believe private action alone is not enough. Yet there is value<br/>in learning something from what this private action produces, as its lesson<br/>may help policy makers recraft copyright law in the future.<br/>

E L E V E N<br/>
p r i v a c y<br/>
THE CONCLUSION OF PART 1 WAS THAT CODE COULD ENABLE A MORE REGULABLE<br/>cyberspace; the conclusion of Part 2 was that code would become an increas-<br/>ingly important regulator in that more regulable space. Both conclusions were<br/>central to the story of the previous chapter. Contrary to the early panic by<br/>copyright holders, the Internet will become a space where intellectual prop-<br/>erty can be more easily protected. As I’ve described, that protection will be<br/>effected through code.<br/>
Privacy is a surprisingly similar story. Indeed, as Jonathan Zittrain argued<br/>
in an essay published in the <i>Stanford Law Review,</i>1 the problems of privacy<br/>and copyright are exactly the same. With both, there’s a bit of “our” data that<br/>“we’ve” lost control over. In the case of copyright, it is the data constituting a<br/>copy of our copyrighted work; in the case of privacy, it is the data representing<br/>some fact about us. In both cases, the Internet has produced this loss of con-<br/>trol: with copyright, because the technology enables perfect and free copies of<br/>content; with privacy, as we’ll see in this chapter, because the technology<br/>enables perpetual and cheap monitoring of behavior. In both cases, the ques-<br/>tion policy makers should ask is what mix of law and technology might<br/>restore the proper level of control. That level must balance private and public<br/>interests: With copyright, the balance is as I described in the last chapter; with<br/>privacy, it is as we’ll explore in this chapter.<br/>
The big difference between copyright and privacy, however, is the political<br/>
economy that seeks a solution to each problem. With copyright, the interests<br/>threatened are powerful and well organized; with privacy, the interests threat-<br/>ened are diffuse and disorganized. With copyright, the values on the other side<br/>of protection (the commons, or the public domain) are neither compelling<br/>nor well understood. With privacy, the values on the other side of protection<br/>
200<br/>

privacy<br/>
201<br/>
(security, the war against terrorism) <i>are </i>compelling and well understood. The<br/>result of these differences, as any political theorist would then predict, is that<br/>over the past ten years, while we’ve seen a lot of legislative and technical<br/>changes to solve the problems facing copyright, we’ve seen very few that<br/>would solve the problems of privacy.<br/>
Yet as with copyright, we could restrike the balance protecting privacy.<br/>
There are both changes in law and changes in technology that could produce<br/>a much more private (and secure) digital environment. Whether we will real-<br/>ize these changes depends upon recognizing both the dynamics to regulation<br/>in cyberspace and the importance of the value that privacy is.<br/>{TXB2}<br/>We will think about three aspects of privacy, and how cyberspace has changed<br/>each of them. Two of these three will be the focus of this chapter, but I begin<br/>with the third to help orient the balance.<br/>
PRIVACY IN PRIVATE<br/>
The traditional question of “privacy” was the limit the law placed upon the<br/>ability of others to penetrate your private space. What right does the govern-<br/>ment have to enter your home, or search your papers? What protection does<br/>the law of trespass provide against others beyond the government snooping<br/>into your private stuff? This is one meaning of Brandeis’s slogan, “the right to<br/>be left alone.”2 From the perspective of the law, it is the set of legal restrictions<br/>on the power of others to invade a protected space.<br/>
Those legal restrictions were complemented by physical barriers. The law<br/>
of trespass may well say it’s illegal to enter my house at night, but that doesn’t<br/>mean I won’t lock my doors or bolt my windows. Here again, the protection<br/>one enjoys is the sum of the protections provided by the four modalities of<br/>regulation. Law supplements the protections of technology, the protections<br/>built into norms, and the protections from the costliness of illegal penetra-<br/>tion.<br/>
Digital technologies have changed these protections. The cost of para-<br/>
bolic microphone technology has dropped dramatically; that means it’s<br/>easier for me to listen to your conversation through your window. On the<br/>other hand, the cost of security technologies to monitor intrusion has also<br/>fallen dramatically. The net of these changes is difficult to reckon, but the<br/>core value is not rendered ambiguous by this difficulty. The expectation of<br/>privacy in what is reasonably understood to be “private” spaces remains<br/>unchallenged by new technologies. This sort of privacy doesn’t present a<br/>“latent ambiguity.”<br/>

202<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
PRIVACY IN PUBLIC: SURVEILLANCE<br/>
A second kind of privacy will seem at first oxymoronic—privacy in public.<br/>What kind of protection is there against gathering data about me while I’m on<br/>a public street, or boarding an airplane?<br/>
The traditional answer was simple: None. By stepping into the public,<br/>
you relinquished any rights to hide or control what others came to know<br/>about you. The facts that you transmitted about yourself were as “free as the<br/>air to common use.”3 The law provided no legal protection against the use of<br/>data gathered in public contexts.<br/>
But as we’ve seen again and again, just because the law of privacy didn’t<br/>
protect you it doesn’t follow that you weren’t protected. Facts about you while<br/>you are in public, even if not legally protected, are effectively protected by the<br/>high cost of gathering or using those facts. Friction is thus privacy’s best<br/>friend.<br/>
To see the protection that this friction creates, however, we must distin-<br/>
guish between two dimensions along which privacy might be compromised.<br/>
There is a part of anyone’s life that is <i>monitored, </i>and there is a part that<br/>
can be <i>searched</i>. The monitored is that part of one’s daily existence that others<br/>see or notice and can respond to, if response is appropriate. As I walk down<br/>the street, my behavior is monitored. If I walked down the street in a small vil-<br/>lage in western China, my behavior would be monitored quite extensively.<br/>This monitoring in both cases would be transitory. People would notice, for<br/>example, if I were walking with an elephant or in a dress, but if there were<br/>nothing special about my walk, if I simply blended into the crowd, then I<br/>might be noticed for the moment but forgotten soon after—more quickly in<br/>San Francisco, perhaps, than in China.<br/>
The <i>searchable </i>is the part of your life that leaves, or is, a record. Scrib-<br/>
blings in your diary are a record of your thoughts. Stuff in your house is a<br/>record of what you possess. The recordings on your telephone answering<br/>machine are a record of who called and what they said. Your hard drive is you.<br/>These parts of your life are not ephemeral. They instead remain to be<br/>reviewed—at least if technology and the law permit.<br/>
These two dimensions can interact, depending upon the technology in<br/>
each. My every action in a small village may be monitored by my neighbors.<br/>That monitoring produces a record—in their memories. But given the nature<br/>of the recording technology, it is fairly costly for the government to search that<br/>record. Police officers need to poll the neighbors; they need to triangulate on<br/>the inevitably incomplete accounts to figure out what parts are true, and what<br/>parts are not. That’s a familiar process, but it has its limits. It might be easy to<br/>

privacy<br/>
203<br/>
poll the neighbors to learn information to help locate a lost person, but if the<br/>government asked questions about the political views of a neighbor, we might<br/>expect (hope?) there would be resistance to that. Thus, in principle, the data<br/>are there. In practice, they are costly to extract.<br/>
Digital technologies change this balance—radically. They not only make<br/>
more behavior monitorable; they also make more behavior searchable. The<br/>same technologies that gather data now gather it in a way that makes it search-<br/>able. Thus, increasingly life becomes a village composed of parallel processors,<br/>accessible at any time to reconstruct events or track behavior.<br/>
Consider some familiar examples:<br/>
The Internet<br/>
In Part I, I described the anonymity the Internet originally provided. But let’s<br/>be clear about something important: That relative anonymity of the “old<br/>days” is now effectively gone. Everywhere you go on the Internet, the fact that<br/>IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx went there is recorded. Everywhere you go where<br/>you’ve allowed a cookie to be deposited, the fact that the machine carrying<br/>that cookie went there is recorded—as well as all the data associated with<br/>that cookie. They know you from your mouse droppings. And as businesses<br/>and advertisers work more closely together, the span of data that can be aggre-<br/>gated about you becomes endless.<br/>
Consider a hypothetical that is completely technically possible under the<br/>
existing architectures of the Net. You go to a web page of a company you<br/>trust, and you give that company every bit of your private data—your name,<br/>address, social security number, favorite magazines and TV shows, etc. That<br/>company gives you a cookie. You then go to another site, one you don’t trust.<br/>You decide not to give that site any personal data. But there’s no way for you<br/>to know whether these companies are cooperating about the data they collect.<br/>Its perfectly possible they synchronize the cookies data they create. And thus,<br/>there’s no technical reason why once you’ve given your data once, it isn’t<br/>known by a wide range of sites that you visit.<br/>
In the section that follows, we’ll consider more extensively how we<br/>
should think about privacy in any data I’ve affirmatively provided others,<br/>such as my name, address, or social security number. But for the moment,<br/>just focus upon the identity data they’ve collected as I move around in<br/>“public.” Unless you’ve taken extraordinary steps—installing privacy soft-<br/>ware on your computer, or disabling cookies, etc.—there’s no reason you<br/>should expect that the fact that you visited certain sites, or ran certain<br/>searches, isn’t knowable by someone. It is. The layers of technology designed<br/>

204<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
to identify “the customer” have produced endless layers of data that can be<br/>traced back to you.<br/>
Searches<br/>
In January 2006, Google surprised the government by doing what no other<br/>search company had done: It told the government “no.” The Justice Depart-<br/>ment had launched a study of pornography on the Net as a way to defend<br/>Congress’s latest regulation of pornography. It thus wanted data about how<br/>often, and in what form, people search for porn on the Internet. It asked<br/>Google to provide 1,000,000 random searches from its database over a spec-<br/>ified period. Google—unlike Yahoo! and MSN—refused.<br/>
I suspect that when most first heard about this, they asked themselves an<br/>
obvious question—Google keeps search requests? It does. Curiosity is mon-<br/>itored, producing a searchable database of the curious. As a way to figure out<br/>better how to do its job, Google—and every other search engine4—keeps a<br/>copy of every search it’s asked to make. More disturbingly, Google links that<br/>search to a specific IP address, and, if possible, to a Google users’ account.<br/>Thus, in the bowels of Google’s database, there is a list of all searches made<br/>by you when you were logged into your gmail account, sitting, waiting, for<br/>someone to ask to see it.<br/>
The government did ask. And in the normal course of things, the govern-<br/>
ment’s request would be totally ordinary. It is unquestioned that the govern-<br/>ment gets to ask those with relevant evidence to provide it for an ongoing civil<br/>or criminal investigation (there are limits, but none really significant). Google<br/>has evidence; the government would ordinarily have the right to get it.<br/>
Moreover, the government in this case explicitly promised it would not<br/>
use this evidence for anything more than evaluating patterns of consumption<br/>around porn. In particular, it promised it wouldn’t trace any particularly sus-<br/>picious searches. It would ignore that evidence—which ordinarily it would be<br/>free to use for whatever purpose it chose—just so it could get access to aggre-<br/>gate data about searches for porn.<br/>
So what’s the problem this example illustrates?<br/>Before search engines, no one had any records of curiosity; there was no<br/>
list of questions asked. Now there is. People obsessively pepper search engines<br/>with questions about everything. The vast majority of these are totally<br/>benign (“mushrooms AND ragout”). Some of them show something less<br/>benign about the searcher (“erotic pictures AND children”). Now there’s a list<br/>of all these questions, with some providing evidence of at least criminal<br/>intent.<br/>

privacy<br/>
205<br/>
The government’s interest in that list will increase. At first, its demands<br/>
will seem quite harmless—so what if it counts the number of times people ask<br/>Google to point them to erotic pictures? Then, when not so harmless, the<br/>demands will link to very harmful behavior—searches that suggest terrorism,<br/>or abuse. Who could argue against revealing that? Finally, when not so harm-<br/>less, and when the crime is not so harmful, the demands will simply insist this<br/>is an efficient way to enforce the law. “If you don’t like the law, change it. But<br/>until you do, let us enforce it.” The progression is obvious, inevitable, and<br/>irresistible.<br/>
E-mail<br/>
Electronic mail is a text-based message stored in digital form. It is like a tran-<br/>scribed telephone call. When sent from one person to another, e-mail is<br/>copied and transmitted from machine to machine; it sits on these different<br/>machines until removed either by routines—decisions by machines—or by<br/>people.<br/>
The content of many e-mail messages is like the content of an ordinary<br/>
telephone call—unplanned, unthinking, the ordinary chatter of friends. But<br/>unlike a telephone call, this content is saved in a searchable form. Companies<br/>now invest millions in technologies that scan the conversations of employees<br/>that before were effectively private. Both in real time and in retrospect, the<br/>content of conversations can become known. On the theory that they “own<br/>the computer,”5 employers increasingly snoop in the e-mail of employees,<br/>looking for stuff they deem improper.6<br/>
In principle, such monitoring and searching are possible with telephone<br/>
calls or letters. In practice, these communications are not monitored. To mon-<br/>itor telephones or regular mail requires time and money—that is, human<br/>intervention. And this cost means that most won’t do it. Here again, the costs<br/>of control yield a certain kind of freedom.<br/>
Controlling employees (or spouses) is one important new use of e-mail<br/>
technologies. Another is the better delivery of advertisement. Google is again<br/>the leader here with its new Gmail service. Gmail can advertise to you as you read<br/>your e-mail. But the advance is that the advertisement is triggered by the content<br/>of the e-mail. Imagine a television that shifted its advertisement as it heard what<br/>you were talking about on the phone. The content of the e-mail—and perhaps<br/>the content of your inbox generally—helps determine what is shown to you.<br/>
To make this system work well, Google needs you to keep lots of data on<br/>
its servers. Thus the only thing within Gmail that is difficult to do—and it is<br/>really really difficult—is to delete content from a Google Gmail account.<br/>

206<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Gmail lets you delete one screen at a time. But when you have 20,000 e-mails<br/>in your inbox, who has time? Would it be difficult for Gmail to enable a<br/>“delete all” function? Of course not. This is Google! Thus, through the clever<br/>use of architecture, Google assures more data is kept, and that data then<br/>becomes a resource for other purposes. If you ever get involved in a lawsuit,<br/>the first question of the lawyer from the other side should be—do you have a<br/>Gmail account? Because, if you do, your life sits open for review.<br/>
V-mail<br/>
If e-mail becomes a permanent record, why not v-mail? Voice mail systems<br/>archive messages and record the communication attributes of the conversa-<br/>tions. As technologies for voice recognition improve, so does the ability to<br/>search voice records. As voice mail systems shift to digital systems, archiving<br/>content on central servers rather than $50 devices connected to the phone at<br/>home, they become practical search resources. In principle, every night the<br/>government could scan all the stored voice recordings at every telephone<br/>company in the nation. This search would impose no burden on the user; it<br/>could be targeted on and limited to specific topics, and it could operate in the<br/>background without anyone ever knowing.<br/>
Voice<br/>
And why stop with recordings? According to one report, the NSA monitors<br/>over 650 million telephone conversations <i>a day</i>.7 That monitoring is auto-<br/>matic. It used to be of foreigners only, but now apparently the system moni-<br/>tors an extraordinary range of communication, searching for that bit or clue<br/>that triggers investigative concern. The system produces something akin to a<br/>weather report as well as particularized indicators. There are, for example,<br/>measures of “chatter” that may signal a storm.<br/>
This monitoring, like each of the examples before, creates no burden for<br/>
those using a telephone. Those using the phone don’t know something is lis-<br/>tening on the other end. Instead, the system works quietly in the background,<br/>searching this monitored communication in real time.<br/>
Video<br/>
In each of the examples so far, someone has chosen to use a technology, and<br/>that technology has made their privacy vulnerable. The change is produced as<br/>that technology evolves to make it simpler to monitor and search behavior.<br/>

privacy<br/>
207<br/>
But the same evolution is happening outside networks as well. Indeed, it<br/>
is happening in the quintessentially public place—the streets, or in public<br/>venues. This monitoring is the production of the current version of video<br/>technology. Originally, video cameras were a relatively benign form of mon-<br/>itoring. Because the product of their monitoring relied solely upon human<br/>interpretation, there were relatively few contexts in which it paid to have<br/>someone watch. And where someone wasn’t watching in real time, then the<br/>use of these technologies is to trace bad behavior after it happens. Few seem<br/>upset when a convenience store video camera makes it possible to identify the<br/>criminal who has murdered the attendant.<br/>
Digital technology has changed the video, however. It is now a tool of<br/>
intelligence, not just a tool to record. In London, as I’ve described, cameras are<br/>spread through the city to monitor which cars drive in the city. This is because<br/>nonresidents must pay a special tax to drive in “congestion zones.” The cam-<br/>eras record and interpret license places, and then determine whether the right<br/>tax was paid for that car. The objective of the system was to minimize conges-<br/>tion in London. Its consequence is a database of every car that enters London,<br/>tied to a particular time and location.<br/>
But the more ambitious use of video surveillance is human face recogni-<br/>
tion. While the technology received some very bad press when first intro-<br/>duced in Tampa,8 the government continues to encourage companies to<br/>develop the capacity to identify who someone is while that someone is in a<br/>traditionally anonymous place. As one vendor advertises, “[f]ace recognition<br/>technology is the least intrusive and fastest biometric technology. . . . There<br/>is no intrusion or delay, and in most cases the subjects are entirely unaware<br/>of the process. They do not feel ‘under surveillance’ or that their privacy has<br/>been invaded.”9<br/>
These technologies aren’t yet reliable. But they continue to be funded by<br/>
both private investors and the government. Indeed, the government runs<br/>evaluation tests bi-annually to rate the reliability of the technologies.10 There<br/>must at least be someone who expects that someday it will possible to use a<br/>camera to identify who is in a crowd, or who boarded a train.<br/>
Body Parts<br/>
Criminals leave evidence behind, both because they’re usually not terribly<br/>rational and because it’s extremely hard not to. And technology is only mak-<br/>ing it harder not to. With DNA technology, it becomes increasingly difficult<br/>for a criminal to avoid leaving his mark, and increasingly easy for law enforce-<br/>ment to identify with extremely high confidence whether X did Y.<br/>

208<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Some nations have begun to capitalize on this new advantage. And again,<br/>
Britain is in the lead.11 Beginning in 1995, the British government started col-<br/>lecting DNA samples to include in a national registry. The program was ini-<br/>tially promoted as a way to fight terrorism. But in a decade, its use has become<br/>much less discriminating.<br/>
In December 2005, while riding public transportation in London, I read<br/>
the following on a public announcement poster:<br/>
Abuse, Assault, Arrest: Our staff are here to help you. Spitting on DLR staff is clas-<br/>
sified as an assault and is a criminal offence. Saliva Recovery Kits are now held on<br/>
every train and will be used to identify offenders against the national DNA database.<br/>
And why not? Spitting may be harmless. But it is insulting. And if the<br/>
tools exist to identify the perpetrator of the insult, why not use them?<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
In all these cases, technologies designed either without monitoring as their<br/>aim or with just limited monitoring as their capacity have now become expert<br/>technologies for monitoring. The aggregate of these technologies produces an<br/>extraordinary range of searchable data. And, more importantly, as these tech-<br/>nologies mature, there will be essentially no way for anyone living within<br/>ordinary society to escape this monitoring. Monitoring to produce searchable<br/>data will become the default architecture for public space, as standard as street<br/>lights. From the simple ability to trace back to an individual, to the more<br/>troubling ability to know what that individual is doing or likes at any partic-<br/>ular moment, the maturing data infrastructure produces a panopticon<br/>beyond anything Bentham ever imagined.<br/>
“Orwell” is the word you’re looking for. And while I believe that analogies<br/>
to Orwell are just about always useless, let’s make one comparison here<br/>nonetheless. While the ends of the government in <i>1984 </i>were certainly vastly<br/>more evil than anything our government would ever pursue, it is interesting<br/>to note just how inefficient, relative to the current range of technologies,<br/>Orwell’s technologies were. The central device was a “telescreen” that both<br/>broadcasted content and monitored behavior on the other side. But the great<br/>virtue of the telescreen was that you knew what it, in principle, could see.<br/>Winston knew where to hide, because the perspective of the telescreen was<br/>transparent.12 It was easy to know what it couldn’t see, and hence easy to<br/>know where to do the stuff you didn’t want it to see.<br/>
That’s not the world we live in today. You can’t know whether your search<br/>
on the Internet is being monitored. You don’t know whether a camera is try-<br/>ing to identify who you are. Your telephone doesn’t make funny clicks as the<br/>

privacy<br/>
209<br/>
NSA listens in. Your e-mail doesn’t report when some bot has searched it.<br/>The technologies of today have none of the integrity of the technologies of<br/><i>1984</i>. None are decent enough to let you know when your life is being<br/>recorded.<br/>
There’s a second difference as well. The great flaw to the design of <i>1984</i><br/>
was in imagining just how it was that behavior was being monitored. There<br/>were no computers in the story. The monitoring was done by gaggles of<br/>guards watching banks of televisions. But that monitoring produced no sim-<br/>ple way for the guards to connect their intelligence. There was no search<br/>across the brains of the guards. Sure, a guard might notice that you’re talking<br/>to someone you shouldn’t be talking to or that you’ve entered a part of a city<br/>you shouldn’t be in. But there was no single guard who had a complete picture<br/>of the life of Winston.<br/>
Again, that “imperfection” can now be eliminated. We can monitor every-<br/>
thing and search the product of that monitoring. Even Orwell couldn’t imag-<br/>ine that.<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
I’ve surveyed a range of technologies to identify a common form. In each, the<br/>individual acts in a context that is technically public. I don’t mean it should<br/>be treated by the law as “public” in the sense that privacy should not be pro-<br/>tected there. I’m not addressing that question yet. I mean only that the indi-<br/>vidual is putting his words or image in a context that he doesn’t control.<br/>Walking down 5th Avenue is the clearest example. Sending a letter is another.<br/>In both cases, the individual has put himself in a stream of activity that he<br/>doesn’t control.<br/>
The question for us, then, is what limits there should be—in the name of<br/>
“privacy”—on the ability to surveil these activities. But even that question<br/>puts the matter too broadly. By “surveil,” I don’t mean surveillance generally.<br/>I mean the very specific kind of surveillance the examples above evince. I<br/>mean what we could call “digital surveillance.”<br/>
“Digital surveillance” is the process by which some form of human activ-<br/>
ity is analyzed by a computer according to some specified rule. The rule might<br/>say “flag all e-mail talking about Al Qaeda.” Or it might say “flag all e-mail<br/>praising Governor Dean.” Again, at this point I’m not focused upon the nor-<br/>mative or legal question of whether such surveillance should be allowed. At<br/>this point, we’re just working through definitions. In each of the cases above,<br/>the critical feature in each is that a computer is sorting data for some follow-<br/>up review by some human. The sophistication of the search is a technical<br/>question, but there’s no doubt that its accuracy is improving substantially.<br/>
So should this form of monitoring be allowed?<br/>

210<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
I find when I ask this question framed precisely like this that there are two<br/>
polar opposite reactions. On the one hand, friends of privacy say that there’s<br/>nothing new here. There’s no difference between the police reading your mail,<br/>and the police’s computer reading your e-mail. In both cases, a legitimate<br/>and reasonable expectation of privacy has been breached. In both cases, the<br/>law should protect against that breach.<br/>
On the other hand, friends of security insist there is a fundamental differ-<br/>
ence. As Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <i>Washington Post, </i>in an article<br/>defending the Bush Administration’s (extensive13) surveillance of domestic<br/>communications, “[m]achine collection and processing of data cannot, as<br/>such, invade privacy.” Why? Because it is a machine that is processing the<br/>data. Machines don’t gossip. They don’t care about your affair with your co-<br/>worker. They don’t punish you for your political opinions. They’re just logic<br/>machines that act based upon conditions. Indeed, as Judge Posner argues,<br/>“[t]his initial sifting, far from invading privacy (a computer is not a sentient<br/>being), keeps most private data from being read by any intelligence officer.”<br/>We’re better off having machines read our e-mail, Posner suggests, both<br/>because of the security gain, and because the alternative snoop—an intelli-<br/>gence officer—would be much more nosey.<br/>
But it would go too far to suggest there isn’t some cost to this system. If we<br/>
lived in a world where our every communication was monitored (if?), that<br/>would certainly challenge the sense that we were “left alone.” We would be left<br/>alone in the sense a toddler is left in a playroom—with parents listening care-<br/>fully from the next room. There would certainly be something distinctively<br/>different about the world of perpetual monitoring, and that difference must<br/>be reckoned in any account of whether this sort of surveillance should be<br/>allowed.<br/>
We should also account for the “best intentions” phenomenon. Systems of<br/>
surveillance are instituted for one reason; they get used for another. Jeff Rosen<br/>has cataloged the abuses of the surveillance culture that Britain has become:14<br/>Video cameras used to leer at women or for sensational news stories. Or in the<br/>United States, the massive surveillance for the purpose of tracking “terrorists”<br/>was also used to track domestic environmental and antiwar groups.15<br/>
But let’s frame the question in its most compelling form. Imagine a sys-<br/>
tem of digital surveillance in which the algorithm was known and verifiable:<br/>We knew, that is, exactly what was being searched for; we trusted that’s all<br/>that was being searched for. That surveillance was broad and indiscriminate.<br/>But before anything could be done on the basis of the results from that sur-<br/>veillance, a court would have to act. So the machine would spit out bits of<br/>data implicating X in some targeted crime, and a court would decide<br/>

privacy<br/>
211<br/>
whether that data sufficed either to justify an arrest or a more traditional<br/>search. And finally, to make the system as protective as we can, the only evi-<br/>dence that could be used from this surveillance would be evidence directed<br/>against the crimes being surveilled for. So for example, if you’re looking for<br/>terrorists, you don’t use the evidence to prosecute for tax evasion. I’m not<br/>saying what the targeted crimes are; all I’m saying is that we don’t use the<br/>traditional rule that allows all evidence gathered legally to be usable for any<br/>legal end.<br/>
Would such a system violate the protections of the Fourth Amendment?<br/>
Should it?<br/>
The answer to this question depends upon your conception of the value<br/>
protected by the Fourth Amendment. As I described in Chapter 6, that<br/>amendment was targeted against indiscriminate searches and “general war-<br/>rants”—that is, searches that were not particularized to any particular individ-<br/>ual and the immunity that was granted to those engaging in that search. But<br/>those searches, like any search at that time, imposed burdens on the person<br/>being searched. If you viewed the value the Fourth Amendment protected as<br/>the protection from the unjustified burden of this indiscriminate search, then<br/>this digital surveillance would seem to raise no significant problems. As<br/>framed above, they produce no burden at all unless sufficient evidence is dis-<br/>covered to induce a court to authorize a search.<br/>
But it may be that we understand the Fourth Amendment to protect a<br/>
kind of dignity. Even if a search does not burden anyone, or even if one<br/>doesn’t notice the search at all, this conception of privacy holds that the very<br/>idea of a search is an offense to dignity. That dignity interest is only matched<br/>if the state has a good reason to search <i>before </i>it searches. From this perspec-<br/>tive, a search without justification harms your dignity whether it interferes<br/>with your life or not.<br/>
I saw these two conceptions of privacy play out against each other in a<br/>
tragically common encounter in Washington, D.C. A friend and I had<br/>arranged a “police ride-along”—riding with District police during their ordi-<br/>nary patrol. The neighborhood we patrolled was among the poorest in the<br/>city, and around 11:00 P.M. a report came in that a car alarm had been tripped<br/>in a location close to ours. When we arrived near the scene, at least five police<br/>officers were attempting to hold three youths; three of the officers were hold-<br/>ing the suspects flat against the wall, with their legs spread and their faces<br/>pressed against the brick.<br/>
These three were “suspects”—they were near a car alarm when it went<br/>
off—and yet, from the looks of things, you would have thought they had<br/>been caught holding the Hope diamond.<br/>

212<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
And then an extraordinary disruption broke out. To the surprise of every-<br/>
one, and to my terror (for this seemed a tinder box, and what I am about to<br/>describe seemed the match), one of the three youths, no older than seventeen,<br/>turned around in a fit of anger and started screaming at the cops. “Every time<br/>anything happens in this neighborhood, I get thrown against the wall, and a<br/>gun pushed against my head. I’ve never done anything illegal, but I’m con-<br/>stantly being pushed around by cops with guns.”<br/>
His friend then turned around and tried to calm him down. “Cool it,<br/>
man, they’re just trying to do their job. It’ll be over in a minute, and every-<br/>thing will be cool.”<br/>
“I’m not going to cool it. Why the fuck do I have to live this way? I am not<br/>
a criminal. I don’t deserve to be treated like this. Someday one of these guns<br/>is going to go off by accident—and then I’ll be a fucking statistic. What then?”<br/>
At this point the cops intervened, three of them flipping the indignant<br/>
youth around against the wall, his face again flat against the brick. “This will<br/>be over in a minute. If you check out, you’ll be free to go. Just relax.”<br/>
In the voice of rage of the first youth was the outrage of dignity denied.<br/>
Whether reasonable or not, whether minimally intrusive or not, there was<br/>something insulting about this experience—all the more insulting when<br/>repeated, one imagines, over and over again. As Justice Scalia has written,<br/>wondering whether the framers of the Constitution would have considered<br/>constitutional the police practice known as a “Terry stop”—stopping and<br/>frisking any individual whenever the police have a reasonable suspicion—“I<br/>frankly doubt . . . whether the fiercely proud men who adopted our Fourth<br/>Amendment would have allowed themselves to be subjected, on mere suspi-<br/>cion of being armed and dangerous, to such indignity.”16<br/>
And yet again, there is the argument of minimal intrusion. If privacy is a<br/>
protection against unjustified and excessive disruption, then this was no inva-<br/>sion of privacy. As the second youth argued, the intrusion was minimal; it<br/>would pass quickly (as it did—five minutes later, after their identification<br/>checked out, we had left); and it was reasonably related to some legitimate<br/>end. Privacy here is simply the protection against unreasonable and burden-<br/>some intrusions, and this search, the second youth argued, was not so unrea-<br/>sonable and burdensome as to justify the fit of anger (which also risked a<br/>much greater danger).<br/>
From this perspective, the harm in digital surveillance is even harder to<br/>
reckon. I’m certain there are those who feel an indignity at the very idea that<br/>records about them are being reviewed by computers. But most would recog-<br/>nize a very different dignity at stake here. Unlike those unfortunate kids<br/>against the wall, there is no real interference here at all. Very much as with<br/>

privacy<br/>
213<br/>
those kids, if nothing is found, nothing will happen. So what is the indignity?<br/>How is it expressed?<br/>
A third conception of privacy is about neither preserving dignity nor<br/>
minimizing intrusion. It is instead substantive—privacy as a way to constrain<br/>the power of the state to regulate. Here the work of William Stuntz is a guide.17<br/>Stuntz argues that the real purpose of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments is to<br/>make some types of regulation too difficult by making the evidence needed to<br/>prosecute such violations effectively impossible to gather.<br/>
This is a hard idea for us to imagine. In our world, the sources of evidence<br/>
are many—credit card records, telephone records, video cameras at 7-<br/>Elevens—so it’s hard for us to imagine any crime that there wouldn’t be some<br/>evidence to prosecute. But put yourself back two hundred years when the<br/>only real evidence was testimony and things, and the rules of evidence forbade<br/>the defendant from testifying at all. Imagine in that context the state wanted<br/>to punish you for “sedition.” The only good evidence of sedition would be<br/>your writings or your own testimony about your thoughts. If those two<br/>sources were eliminated, then it would be practically impossible to prosecute<br/>sedition successfully.<br/>
As Stuntz argues, this is just what the Fourth and Fifth Amendments do.<br/>
Combined, they make collecting the evidence for a crime like sedition impos-<br/>sible, thereby making it useless for the state to try to prosecute it. And not just<br/>sedition—as Stuntz argues, the effect of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amend-<br/>ments was to restrict the scope of regulation that was practically possible. As<br/>he writes: “Just as a law banning the use of contraceptives would tend to<br/>encourage bedroom searches, so also would a ban on bedroom searches tend<br/>to discourage laws prohibiting contraceptives.”18<br/>
But were not such searches already restricted by, for example, the First<br/>
Amendment? Would not a law punishing seditious libel have been unconsti-<br/>tutional in any case? In fact, that was not at all clear at the founding; indeed,<br/>it was so unclear that in 1798 Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,<br/>which in effect punished sedition quite directly.19 Many thought these laws<br/>unconstitutional, but the Fourth and Fifth Amendments would have been<br/>effective limits on their enforcement, whether the substantive laws were con-<br/>stitutional or not.<br/>
In this conception, privacy is meant as a substantive limit on govern-<br/>
ment’s power.20 Understood this way, privacy does more than protect dignity<br/>or limit intrusion; privacy limits what government can do.<br/>
If this were the conception of privacy, then digital surveillance could well<br/>
accommodate it. If there were certain crimes that it was inappropriate to<br/>prosecute, we could remove them from the search algorithm. It would be<br/>

214<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
hard to identify what crimes constitutionally must be removed from the algo-<br/>rithm—the First Amendment clearly banishes sedition from the list already.<br/>Maybe the rule simply tracks constitutional limitation.<br/>
Now the key is to recognize that, in principle, these three distinct concep-<br/>
tions of privacy could yield different results depending on the case. A search,<br/>for example, might not be intrusive but might offend dignity. In that case, we<br/>would have to choose a conception of privacy that we believed best captured<br/>the Constitution’s protection.<br/>
At the time of the founding, however, these different conceptions of pri-<br/>
vacy would not, for the most part, have yielded different conclusions. Any<br/>search that reached beyond the substantive limits of the amendment, or<br/>beyond the limits of dignity, would also have been a disturbance. Half of the<br/>framers could have held the dignity conception and half the utility concep-<br/>tion, but because every search would have involved a violation of both, all the<br/>framers could have endorsed the protections of the Fourth Amendment.<br/>
Today, however, that’s not true. Today these three conceptions could yield<br/>
very different results. The utility conception could permit efficient searches<br/>that are forbidden by the dignity and substantive conceptions. The correct<br/>translation (as Brandeis employed the term in the Olmstead wiretapping case)<br/>depends on selecting the proper conception to translate.<br/>
In this sense, our original protections were the product of what Cass Sun-<br/>
stein calls an “incompletely theorized agreement.”21 Given the technology of<br/>the time, there was no reason to work out which theory underlay the consti-<br/>tutional text; all three were consistent with existing technology. But as the<br/>technology has changed, the original context has been challenged. Now that<br/>technologies such as the worm can search without disturbing, there is a con-<br/>flict about what the Fourth Amendment protects.<br/>
This conflict is the other side of Sunstein’s incompletely theorized agree-<br/>
ment. We might say that in any incompletely theorized agreement ambiguities<br/>will be latent, and we can describe contexts where these latencies emerge. The<br/>latent ambiguities about the protection of privacy, for example, are being ren-<br/>dered patent by the evolution of technology. And this in turn forces us to choose.<br/>
Some will once again try to suggest that the choice has been made—by<br/>
our Constitution, in our past. This is the rhetoric of much of our constitu-<br/>tional jurisprudence, but it is not very helpful here. I do not think the framers<br/>worked out what the amendment would protect in a world where perfectly<br/>noninvasive searches could be conducted. They did not establish a constitu-<br/>tion to apply in all possible worlds; they established a constitution for their<br/>world. When their world differs from ours in a way that reveals a choice they<br/>did not have to make, then we need to make that choice.<br/>

PRIVACY IN PUBLIC: DATA<br/>
The story I’ve told so far is about limits on government: What power should<br/>the government have to surveil our activities, at least when those activities are<br/>in public? That’s the special question raised by cyberspace: What limits on<br/>“digital surveillance” should there be? There are, of course, many other more<br/>traditional questions that are also important. But my focus was “digital sur-<br/>veillance.”<br/>
In this part, I consider a third privacy question that is closely related, but<br/>
very distinct. This is the question of what presumptive controls we should<br/>have over the data that we reveal to others. The issue here is not primarily the<br/>control of the government. The question is thus beyond the ordinary reach of<br/>the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the target of this control is private actors<br/>who have either gathered data about me as they’ve observed me, or collected<br/>data from me.<br/>
Again, let’s take this from the perspective of real space first. If I hire a pri-<br/>
vate detective to follow you around, I’ve not violated anyone’s rights. If I<br/>compile a list of places you’ve been, there’s nothing to stop me from selling<br/>that list. You might think this intrusive. You might think it outrageous that<br/>the law would allow this to happen. But again, the law traditionally didn’t<br/>worry much about this kind of invasion because the costs of such surveil-<br/>lance were so high. Celebrities and the famous may wish the rules were dif-<br/>ferent, but for most of us, for most of our history, there was no need for the<br/>law to intervene.<br/>
The same point could be made about the data I turned over to businesses<br/>
or others in the days before the Internet. There was nothing in the law to<br/>limit what these entities did with that data. They could sell it to mailing list<br/>companies or brokers; they could use it however they wanted. Again, the prac-<br/>tical cost of doing things with such data was high, so there wasn’t that much<br/>done with this data. And, more importantly, the invasiveness of any such use<br/>of data was relatively low. Junk mail was the main product, and junk mail in<br/>physical space is not a significant burden.<br/>
But here, as with “digital surveillance,” things have changed dramatically.<br/>
Just a couple stories will give us a taste of the change:<br/>
• In the beginning of 2006, the <i>Chicago Sun-Times </i>reported22 that there were<br/>
websites selling the records of telephone calls made from cell phones. A blog,<br/>
AmericaBlog, demonstrated the fact by purchasing the cell phone records of<br/>
General Wesley Clark. For around $120, the blog was able to prove what most<br/>
would have thought impossible: that anyone with a credit card could find<br/>

216<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
something so personal as the list (and frequency and duration) of people some-<br/>
one calls on a cell phone.<br/>
This conduct was so outrageous that no one really stood up to defend it.<br/>
But the defense isn’t hard to construct. Wesley Clark “voluntarily” dialed the<br/>
numbers on his cell phone. He thus voluntarily turned that data over to the cell<br/>
phone company. Because the cell phone company could sell data, it made it eas-<br/>
ier for the company to keep prices low(er). Clark benefited from those lower<br/>
prices. So what’s his complaint?<br/>
• A number of years ago I received a letter from AT&amp;T. It was addressed to an old<br/>
girlfriend, but the letter had not been forwarded. The address was my then-<br/>
current apartment. AT&amp;T wanted to offer her a new credit card. They were a bit<br/>
late: She and I had broken up eight years before. Since then, she had moved to<br/>
Texas, and I had moved to Chicago, to Washington, back to Chicago, on to New<br/>
Haven, back to Chicago, and finally to Boston, where I had moved twice. My<br/>
peripateticism, however, did not deter AT&amp;T. With great faith in my constancy,<br/>
it believed that a woman I had not even seen in many years was living with me<br/>
in this apartment.<br/>
How did AT&amp;T maintain such a belief? Well, floating about in cyberspace is<br/>
lots of data about me. It has been collected from me ever since I began using<br/>
credit cards, telephones, and who knows what else. The system continuously<br/>
tries to update and refine this extraordinary data set—that is, it profiles who I<br/>
am and, using that profile, determines how it will interact with me.<br/>
These are just the tip of the iceberg. Everything you do on the Net pro-<br/>
duces data. That data is, in aggregate, extremely valuable, more valuable to<br/>commerce than it is to the government. The government (in normal times)<br/>really cares only that you obey some select set of laws. But commerce is keen<br/>to figure out how you want to spend your money, and data does that. With<br/>massive amounts of data about what you do and what you say, it becomes<br/>increasingly possible to market to you in a direct and effective way. Google<br/>Gmail processes the data in your e-mail to see what it should try to sell. Ama-<br/>zon watches what you browse to see what special “Gold Box” offers it can<br/>make. There’s an endless list of entities that want to know more about you to<br/>better serve (at least) their interests. What limits, or restrictions, ought there<br/>to be on them?<br/>
We should begin with an obvious point that might help direct an answer.<br/>
There’s a big difference between (1) collecting data about X to suss out a<br/>crime or a criminal, (2) collecting data about X that will be sold to Y simply<br/>to reveal facts about X (such as his cell phone calls), and (3) collecting data<br/>about X to better market to X. (1) and (2) make X worse off, though if we<br/>

privacy<br/>
217<br/>
believe the crime is properly a crime, then with (1), X is not worse off relative<br/>to where he should be. (3) in principle could make you better off—it facili-<br/>tates advertising that is better targeted and better designed to encourage vol-<br/>untary transactions. I say “in principle” because even though it’s possible that<br/>the ads are better targeted, there are also more of them. On balance, X might<br/>be worse off with the flood of well-targeted offers than with a few less well-<br/>targeted offers. But despite that possibility, the motive of (3) is different from<br/>(1) and (2), and that might well affect how we should respond.<br/>
So let’s begin with the focus on (3): What is the harm from this sort of<br/>
“invasion”? Arguments rage on both sides of this question.<br/>
The “no harm” side assumes that the balance of privacy is struck at the<br/>
line where you reveal information about yourself to the public. Sure, informa-<br/>tion kept behind closed doors or written in a private diary should be pro-<br/>tected by the law. But when you go out in public, when you make transactions<br/>there or send material there, you give up any right to privacy. Others now have<br/>the right to collect data about your public behavior and do with it what suits<br/>them.<br/>
Why is that idea not troubling to these theorists? The reasons are many:<br/>
• First, the harm is actually not very great. You get a discount card at your local<br/>
grocery store; the store then collects data about what you buy. With that data, the<br/>
store may market different goods to you or figure out how better to price its<br/>
products; it may even decide that it should offer different mixes of discounts to<br/>
better serve customers. These responses, the argument goes, are the likely ones,<br/>
because the store’s business is only to sell groceries more efficiently.<br/>
• Second, it is an unfair burden to force others to ignore what you show them. If<br/>
data about you are not usable by others, then it is as if you were requiring others<br/>
to discard what you have deposited on their land. If you do not like others using<br/>
information about you, do not put it in their hands.<br/>
• Third, these data actually do some good. I do not know why Nike thinks I am a<br/>
good person to tell about their latest sneakers, and I do not know why Keds<br/>
does not know to call. In both cases, I suspect the reason is bad data about me.<br/>
I would love it if Nike knew enough to leave me alone. And if these data were<br/>
better collected and sorted, it would.<br/>
• Finally, in general, companies don’t spend money collecting these data to actually<br/>
learn anything about you. They want to learn about people <i>like </i>you. They want<br/>
to know your type. In principle, they would be happy to know your type even if<br/>
they could not then learn who you are. What the merchants want is a way to dis-<br/>
criminate—only in the sense of being able to tell the difference between sorts of<br/>
people.<br/>

218<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
The other side of this argument, however, also has a point. It begins,<br/>
again, by noticing the values that were originally protected by the imperfec-<br/>tion of monitoring technology. This imperfection helped preserve important<br/>substantive values; one such value is the benefit of innocence. At any given<br/>time, there are innocent facts about you that may appear, in a particular con-<br/>text or to a particular set, guilty. Peter Lewis, in a <i>New York Times </i>article called<br/>“Forget Big Brother,” puts the point well:<br/>
Surveillance cameras followed the attractive young blond woman through the<br/>
lobby of the midtown Manhattan hotel, kept a glassy eye on her as she rode the<br/>
elevator up to the 23rd floor and peered discreetly down the hall as she<br/>
knocked at the door to my room. I have not seen the videotapes, but I can<br/>
imagine the digital readout superimposed on the scenes, noting the exact time<br/>
of the encounter. That would come in handy if someone were to question<br/>
later why this woman, who is not my wife, was visiting my hotel room during<br/>
a recent business trip. The cameras later saw us heading off to dinner and to<br/>
the theater—a middle aged, married man from Texas with his arm around a<br/>
pretty East Village woman young enough to be his daughter.<br/>
“As a matter of fact,” Lewis writes, “she is my daughter.”23<br/>One lesson of the story is the burden of these monitored facts. The bur-<br/>
den is on you, the monitored, first to establish your innocence, and second to<br/>assure all who might see these ambiguous facts that you are innocent. Both<br/>processes, however, are imperfect; say what you want, doubts will remain.<br/>There are always some who will not believe your plea of innocence.<br/>
Modern monitoring only exacerbates this problem. Your life becomes an<br/>
ever-increasing record; your actions are forever held in storage, open to being<br/>revealed at any time, and therefore at any time demanding a justification.<br/>
A second value follows directly from this modern capacity for archiving<br/>
data. We all desire to live in separate communities, or among or within sepa-<br/>rate normative spaces. Privacy, or the ability to control data about yourself,<br/>supports this desire. It enables these multiple communities and disables the<br/>power of one dominant community to norm others into oblivion. Think, for<br/>example, about a gay man in an intolerant small town.<br/>
The point comes through most clearly when contrasted with an argument<br/>
advanced by David Brin.24 Brin argues against this concern with privacy—at<br/>least if privacy is defined as the need to block the production and distribution<br/>of data about others. He argues against it because he believes that such an end<br/>is impossible; the genie is out of the bottle. Better, he suggests, to find ways to<br/>ensure that this data-gathering ability is generally available. The solution to<br/>

privacy<br/>
219<br/>
your spying on me is not to block your spying, but to let me spy on you—to<br/>hold you accountable, perhaps for spying, perhaps for whatever else you<br/>might be doing.<br/>
There are two replies to this argument. One asks: Why do we have to<br/>
choose? Why can’t we both control spying and build in checks on the distri-<br/>bution of spying techniques?<br/>
The other reply is more fundamental. Brin assumes that this counter spy-<br/>
ing would be useful to hold others “accountable.” But according to whose<br/>norms? “Accountable” is a benign term only so long as we have confidence in<br/>the community doing the accounting. When we live in multiple communities,<br/>accountability becomes a way for one community to impose its view of pro-<br/>priety on another. Because we do not live in a single community, we do not<br/>live by a single set of values. And perfect accountability can only undermine<br/>this mix of values.<br/>
The imperfection in present monitoring enables this multiplication of<br/>
normative communities. The ability to get along without perfect recording<br/>enables a diversity that perfect knowledge would erase.<br/>
A third value arises from a concern about profiling. If you search within<br/>
Google for “mortgage” in a web search engine, advertising for mortgages<br/>appears on your computer screen. The same for sex and for cars. Advertising<br/>is linked to the search you submit. Data is collected, but not just about the<br/>search. Different sites collect just about every bit of personal information<br/>about you that they can.25 And when you link from the Google search to a web<br/>page, the search you just performed is passed along to the next site.<br/>
Data collection is the dominant activity of commercial websites. Some 92<br/>
percent of them collect personal data from web users, which they then aggre-<br/>gate, sort, and use.26 Oscar Gandy calls this the “panoptic sort”—a vast struc-<br/>ture for collecting data and discriminating on the basis of that data—and it is<br/>this discrimination, he says, that ought to concern us.27<br/>
But why should it concern us? Put aside an important class of problems—<br/>
the misuse of the data—and focus instead on its ordinary use. As I said earlier,<br/>the main effect is simply to make the market work more smoothly: Interests<br/>and products are matched to people in a way that is better targeted and less<br/>intrusive than what we have today. Imagine a world where advertisers could<br/>tell which venues paid and which did not; where it was inefficient to advertise<br/>with billboards and on broadcasts; where most advertising was targeted and<br/>specific. Advertising would be more likely to go to those people for whom it<br/>would be useful information. Or so the argument goes. This is discrimination,<br/>no doubt, but not the discrimination of Jim Crow. It is the wonderful sort of<br/>discrimination that spares me Nike ads.<br/>

220<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
But beyond a perhaps fleeting concern about how such data affect the<br/>
individual, profiling raises a more sustained collective concern about how it<br/>might affect a community.<br/>
That concern is manipulation. You might be skeptical about the power of<br/>
television advertising to control people’s desires: Television is so obvious, the<br/>motives so clear. But what happens when the motive is not so obvious? When<br/>options just seem to appear right when you happen to want them? When the<br/>system seems to know what you want better and earlier than you do, how can<br/>you know where these desires really come from?<br/>
Whether this possibility is a realistic one, or whether it should be a con-<br/>
cern, are hard and open questions. Steven Johnson argues quite effectively that<br/>in fact these agents of choice will facilitate a much greater range and diver-<br/>sity—even, in part, chaos—of choice.28 But there’s another possibility as<br/>well—profiles will begin to normalize the population from which the norm is<br/>drawn. The observing will affect the observed. The system watches what you<br/>do; it fits you into a pattern; the pattern is then fed back to you in the form of<br/>options set by the pattern; the options reinforce the pattern; the cycle begins<br/>again.<br/>
A second concern is about equality. Profiling raises a question that was<br/>
latent in the market until quite recently. For much of the nineteenth century<br/>in the United States economic thought was animated by an ideal of equality.<br/>In the civil space individuals were held to be equal. They could purchase and<br/>sell equally; they could approach others on equal terms. Facts about individ-<br/>uals might be known, and some of these facts might disqualify them from<br/>some economic transactions—your prior bankruptcy, for example, might<br/>inhibit your ability to make transactions in the future. But in the main, there<br/>were spaces of relative anonymity, and economic transactions could occur<br/>within them.29<br/>
Over time this space of equality has been displaced by economic zonings<br/>
that aim at segregation.30 They are laws, that is, that promote distinctions<br/>based on social or economic criteria.31 The most telling example is zoning<br/>itself. It was not until this century that local law was used to put people into<br/>segregated spaces.32 At first, this law was racially based, but when racially<br/>based zoning was struck down, the techniques of zoning shifted.33<br/>
It is interesting to recall just how contentious this use of law was.34 To<br/>
many, rich and poor alike, it was an affront to the American ideal of equality<br/>to make where you live depend on how much money you had. It always does,<br/>of course, when property is something you must buy. But zoning laws add the<br/>support of law to the segregation imposed by the market. The effect is to re-<br/>create in law, and therefore in society, distinctions among people.<br/>

privacy<br/>
221<br/>
There was a time when we would have defined our country as a place that<br/>
aimed to erase these distinctions. The historian Gordon Wood describes this<br/>goal as an important element of the revolution that gave birth to the United<br/>States.35 The enemy was social and legal hierarchy; the aim was a society of<br/>equality. The revolution was an attack on hierarchies of social rank and the<br/>special privileges they might obtain.<br/>
All social hierarchies require information before they can make discrim-<br/>
inations of rank. Having enough information about people required, histor-<br/>ically, fairly stable social orders. Making fine class distinctions—knowing, for<br/>instance, whether a well-dressed young man was the gentleman he claimed to<br/>be or only a dressed-up tradesman—required knowledge of local fashions,<br/>accents, customs, and manners. Only where there was relatively little mobility<br/>could these systems of hierarchy be imposed.<br/>
As mobility increased, then, these hierarchical systems were challenged.<br/>
Beyond the extremes of the very rich and very poor, the ability to make subtle<br/>distinctions of rank disappeared as the mobility and fluidity of society made<br/>them too difficult to track.<br/>
Profiling changes all this. An efficient and effective system for monitoring<br/>
makes it possible once again to make these subtle distinctions of rank. Collect-<br/>ing data cheaply and efficiently will take us back to the past. Think about fre-<br/>quent flyer miles. Everyone sees the obvious feature of frequent flyer<br/>miles—the free trips for people who fly frequently. This rebate program is<br/>quite harmless on its own. The more interesting part is the power it gives to<br/>airlines to discriminate in their services.<br/>
When a frequent flyer makes a reservation, the reservation carries with it<br/>
a customer profile. This profile might include information about which seat<br/>she prefers or whether she likes vegetarian food. It also tells the reservation<br/>clerk how often this person flies. Some airlines would then discriminate on<br/>the basis of this information. The most obvious way is through seat loca-<br/>tion—frequent flyers get better seats. But such information might also affect<br/>how food is allocated on the flight—the frequent flyers with the most miles<br/>get first choice; those with the fewest may get no choice.<br/>
In the scheme of social justice, of course, this is small potatoes. But my<br/>
point is more general. Frequent flyer systems permit the re-creation of systems<br/>of status. They supply information about individuals that organizations might<br/>value, and use, in dispensing services.36 They make discrimination possible<br/>because they restore information that mobility destroyed. They are ways of<br/>defeating one benefit of anonymity—the benefit of equality.<br/>
Economists will argue that in many contexts this ability to discriminate—<br/>
in effect, to offer goods at different prices to different people—is overall a<br/>

222<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
benefit.37 On average, people are better off if price discrimination occurs than<br/>if it does not. So we are better off, these economists might say, if we facilitate<br/>such discrimination when we can.<br/>
But these values are just one side of the equation. Weighed against them<br/>
are the values of equality. For us they may seem remote, but we should not<br/>assume that because they are remote now they were always remote.<br/>
Take tipping: As benign (if annoying) as you might consider the prac-<br/>
tice of tipping, there was a time at the turn of the century when the very<br/>idea was an insult. It offended a free citizen’s dignity. As Viviana Zelizer<br/>describes it:<br/>
In the early 1900s, as tipping became increasingly popular, it provoked great<br/>
moral and social controversy. In fact, there were nationwide efforts, some suc-<br/>
cessful, by state legislatures to abolish tipping by turning it into a punishable<br/>
misdemeanor. In countless newspaper editorials and magazine articles, in eti-<br/>
quette books, and even in court, tips were closely scrutinized with a mix of<br/>
curiosity, amusement, and ambivalence—and often open hostility. When in<br/>
1907, the government officially sanctioned tipping by allowing commissioned<br/>
officers and enlisted men of the United States Navy to include tips as an item in<br/>
their travel expense vouchers, the decision was denounced as an illegitimate<br/>
endorsement of graft. Periodically, there were calls to organize anti-tipping<br/>
leagues.38<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
There is a conception of equality that would be corrupted by the efficiency<br/>that profiling embraces. That conception is a value to be weighed against effi-<br/>ciency. Although I believe this value is relatively weak in American life, who<br/>am I to say? The important point is not about what is strong or weak, but<br/>about the tension or conflict that lay dormant until revealed by the emerging<br/>technology of profiling.<br/>
The pattern should be familiar by now, because we have seen the change<br/>
elsewhere. Once again, the code changes, throwing into relief a conflict of values.<br/>Whereas before there was relative equality because the information that enabled<br/>discrimination was too costly to acquire, now it pays to discriminate. The dif-<br/>ference—what makes it pay—is the emergence of a code. The code changes, the<br/>behavior changes, and a value latent in the prior regime is displaced.<br/>
We could react by hobbling the code, thus preserving this world. We could<br/>
create constitutional or statutory restrictions that prevent a move to the new<br/>world. Or we could find ways to reconcile this emerging world with the values<br/>we think are fundamental.<br/>

privacy<br/>
223<br/>
SOLUTIONS<br/>
I’ve identified two distinct threats to the values of privacy that the Internet<br/>will create. The first is the threat from “digital surveillance”—the growing<br/>capacity of the government (among others) to “spy” on your activities “in<br/>public.” From Internet access, to e-mail, to telephone calls, to walking on the<br/>street, digital technology is opening up the opportunity for increasingly per-<br/>fect burdenless searches.<br/>
The second threat comes from the increasing aggregation of data by pri-<br/>
vate (among other) entities. These data are gathered not so much to “spy” as<br/>to facilitate commerce. Some of that commerce exploits the source of the<br/>data (Wesley Clark’s cell phone numbers). Some of that commerce tries to<br/>facilitate commerce with the source of that data (targeted ads).<br/>
Against these two different risks, we can imagine four types of responses,<br/>
each mapping one of the modalities that I described in Chapter 7:<br/>
• Law: Legal regulation could be crafted to respond to these threats. We’ll con-<br/>
sider some of these later, but the general form should be clear enough. The<br/>
law could direct the President not to surveil American citizens without rea-<br/>
sonable suspicion, for example. (Whether the President follows the law is a<br/>
separate question.) Or the law could ban the sale of data gathered from cus-<br/>
tomers without express permission of the customers. In either case, the law<br/>
threatens sanctions to change behavior directly. The aim of the law could<br/>
either be to enhance the power of individuals to control data about them, or<br/>
to disable such power (for example, by making certain privacy-related trans-<br/>
actions illegal).<br/>
• Norms: Norms could be used to respond to these threats. Norms among com-<br/>
mercial entities, for example, could help build trust around certain privacy<br/>
protective practices.<br/>
• Markets: In ways that will become clearer below, the market could be used to<br/>
protect the privacy of individuals.<br/>
• Architecture/Code: Technology could be used to protect privacy. Such tech-<br/>
nologies are often referred to as “Privacy Enhancing Technologies.” These are<br/>
technologies designed to give the user more technical control over data asso-<br/>
ciated with him or her.<br/>
As I’ve argued again and again, there is no single solution to policy prob-<br/>
lems on the Internet. Every solution requires a mix of at least two modalities.<br/>And in the balance of this chapter, my aim is to describe a mix for each of<br/>these two threats to privacy.<br/>

224<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
No doubt this mix will be controversial to some. But my aim is not so<br/>
much to push any particular mix of settings on these modality dials, as it is to<br/>demonstrate a certain approach. I don’t insist on the particular solutions I<br/>propose, but I do insist that solutions in the context of cyberspace are the<br/>product of such a mix.<br/>
Surveillance<br/>
The government surveils as much as it can in its fight against whatever its cur-<br/>rent fight is about. When that surveillance is human—wiretapping, or the<br/>like—then traditional legal limits ought to apply. Those limits impose costs<br/>(and thus, using the market, reduce the incidence to those most significant);<br/>they assure at least some review. And, perhaps most importantly, they build<br/>within law enforcement a norm respecting procedure.<br/>
When that surveillance is digital, however, then it is my view that a differ-<br/>
ent set of restrictions should apply. The law should sanction “digital surveil-<br/>lance” if, <i>but only if</i>, a number of conditions apply:<br/>
1. The purpose of the search enabled in the algorithm is described.<br/>
2. The function of the algorithm is reviewed.<br/>
3. The purpose and the function match is certified.<br/>
4. No action—including a subsequent search—can be taken against any individual<br/>
on the basis of the algorithm without judicial review.<br/>
5. With very limited exceptions, no action against any individual can be pursued<br/>
for matters outside the purpose described. Thus, if you’re looking for evidence<br/>
of drug dealing, you can’t use any evidence discovered for prosecuting credit<br/>
card fraud.<br/>
That describes the legal restrictions applied against the government in<br/>
order to enhance privacy. If these are satisfied, then in my view such digital<br/>surveillance should not conflict with the Fourth Amendment. In addition to<br/>these, there are privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) that should be broadly<br/>available to individuals as well. These technologies enable individuals to<br/>achieve anonymity in their transactions online. Many companies and activist<br/>groups help spread these technologies across the network.<br/>
Anonymity in this sense simply means non-traceability. Tools that enable<br/>
this sort of non-traceability make it possible for an individual to send a mes-<br/>sage without the content of that message being traced to the sender. If imple-<br/>mented properly, there is absolutely no technical way to trace that message.<br/>That kind of anonymity is essential to certain kinds of communication.<br/>

privacy<br/>
225<br/>
It is my view that, at least so long as political repression remains a central<br/>
feature of too many world governments, free governments should recognize<br/>a protected legal right to these technologies. I acknowledge that view is con-<br/>troversial. A less extreme view would acknowledge the differences between the<br/>digital world and real world,39 and guarantee a right to pseudonymous com-<br/>munication but not anonymous communication. In this sense, a pseudony-<br/>mous transaction doesn’t obviously or directly link to an individual without<br/>court intervention. But it contains an effective fingerprint that would allow<br/>the proper authority, under the proper circumstances, to trace the communi-<br/>cation back to its originator.<br/>
In this regime, the important question is who is the authority, and what<br/>
process is required to get access to the identification. In my view, the authority<br/>must be the government. The government must subject its demand for reveal-<br/>ing the identity of an individual to judicial process. And the executive should<br/>never hold the technical capacity to make that link on its own.<br/>
Again, no one will like this balance. Friends of privacy will be furious<br/>
with any endorsement of surveillance. But I share Judge Posner’s view that a<br/>sophisticated surveillance technology might actually increase effective privacy,<br/>if it decreases the instances in which humans intrude on other humans. Like-<br/>wise, friends of security will be appalled at the idea that anyone would endorse<br/>technologies of anonymity. “Do you know how hard it is to crack a drug<br/>lord’s encrypted e-mail communication?” one asked me.<br/>
The answer is no, I don’t have a real sense. But I care less about enabling<br/>
the war on drugs than I do about enabling democracies to flourish. Tech-<br/>nologies that enable the latter will enable the former. Or to be less cowardly,<br/>technologies that enable Aung San Suu Kyi to continue to push for democracy<br/>in Burma will enable Al Qaeda to continue to wage its terrorist war against the<br/>United States. I acknowledge that. I accept that might lead others to a less<br/>extreme position. But I would urge the compromise in favor of surveillance to<br/>go no further than protected pseudonymity.<br/>
Control of Data<br/>
The problem of controlling the spread or misuse of data is more complex<br/>and ambiguous. There are uses of personal data that many would object to.<br/>But many is not all. There are some who are perfectly happy to reveal certain<br/>data to certain entities, and there are many more who would become happy<br/>if they could trust that their data was properly used.<br/>
Here again, the solution mixes modalities. But this time, we begin with<br/>
the technology.40<br/>

226<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
As I described extensively in Chapter 4, there is an emerging push to<br/>
build an Identity Layer onto the Internet. In my view, we should view this<br/>Identity Layer as a PET (private enhancing technology): It would enable indi-<br/>viduals to more effectively control the data about them that they reveal. It<br/>would also enable individuals to have a trustable pseudonymous identity that<br/>websites and others should be happy to accept. Thus, with this technology, if<br/>a site needs to know I am over 18, or an American citizen, or authorized to<br/>access a university library, the technology can certify this data without reveal-<br/>ing anything else. Of all the changes to information practices that we could<br/>imagine, this would be the most significant in reducing the extent of redun-<br/>dant or unnecessary data flowing in the ether of the network.<br/>
A second PET to enable greater control over the use of data would be a<br/>
protocol called the Platform for Privacy Preferences (or P3P for short).41 P3P<br/>would enable a <i>machine-readable </i>expression of the privacy preferences of an<br/>individual. It would enable an automatic way for an individual to recognize<br/>when a site does not comply with his privacy preferences. If you surf to a site<br/>that expresses its privacy policy using P3P, and its policy is inconsistent with<br/>your preferences, then depending upon the implementation, either the site or<br/>you are made aware of the problem created by this conflict. The technology<br/>thus could make clear a conflict in preferences. And recognizing that conflict<br/>is the first step to protecting preferences.<br/>
The critical part of this strategy is to make these choices machine-read-<br/>
able. If you Google “privacy policy,” you’ll get close to 2.5 <i>billion </i>hits on the<br/>Web. And if you click through to the vast majority of them (not that you<br/>could do that in this lifetime), you will find that they are among the most<br/>incomprehensible legal texts around (and that’s saying a lot). These policies<br/>are the product of pre-Internet thinking about how to deal with a policy<br/>problem. The government was pushed to “solve” the problem of Internet pri-<br/>vacy. Its solution was to require “privacy policies” be posted everywhere. But<br/>does anybody read these policies? And if they do, do they remember them<br/>from one site to another? Do you know the difference between Amazon’s<br/>policies and Google’s?<br/>
The mistake of the government was in not requiring that those policies<br/>
also be understandable by a computer. Because if we had 2.5 billion sites with<br/>both a human readable and machine readable statement of privacy policies,<br/>then we would have the infrastructure necessary to encourage the develop-<br/>ment of this PET, P3P. But because the government could not think beyond its<br/>traditional manner of legislating—because it didn’t think to require changes<br/>in code as well as legal texts—we don’t have that infrastructure now. But, in<br/>my view, it is critical.<br/>

privacy<br/>
227<br/>
These technologies standing alone, however, do nothing to solve the prob-<br/>
lem of privacy on the Net. It is absolutely clear that to complement these<br/>technologies, we need legal regulation. But this regulation is of three very dif-<br/>ferent sorts. The first kind is substantive—laws that set the boundaries of pri-<br/>vacy protection. The second kind is procedural—laws that mandate fair<br/>procedures for dealing with privacy practices. And the third is enabling—<br/>laws that make enforceable agreements between individuals and corporations<br/>about how privacy is to be respected.<br/>
(1) Limits on Choice<br/>
One kind of legislation is designed to limit individual freedom. Just as labor<br/>law bans certain labor contracts, or consumer law forbids certain credit<br/>arrangements, this kind of privacy law would restrict the freedom of individ-<br/>uals to give up certain aspects of their privacy. The motivation for this limi-<br/>tation could either be substantive or procedural—substantive in that it reflects<br/>a substantive judgment about choices individuals should not make, or proce-<br/>dural in that it reflects the view that systematically, when faced with this<br/>choice, individuals will choose in ways that they regret. In either case, the role<br/>of this type of privacy regulation is to block transactions deemed to weaken<br/>privacy within a community.<br/>
(2) The Process to Protect Privacy<br/>
The most significant normative structure around privacy practices was<br/>framed more than thirty years ago by the HEW (Health, Education, Welfare)<br/>Advisory Committee on Automated Data Systems. This report set out five<br/>principles that were to define the “Code of Fair Information Practices.”42<br/>These principles require:<br/>
1. There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is<br/>
secret.<br/>
2. There must be a way for a person to find out what information about the per-<br/>
son is in a record and how it is used.<br/>
3. There must be a way for a person to prevent information about the person that<br/>
was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other pur-<br/>
poses without the person’s consent.<br/>
4. There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record of identifiable<br/>
information about the person.<br/>

228<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
5. Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of<br/>
identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their<br/>
intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuses of the data.<br/>
These principles express important substantive values—for example, that<br/>
data not be reused beyond an original consent, or that systems for gathering<br/>data be reliable—but they don’t interfere with an individual’s choice to release<br/>his or her own data for specified purposes. They are in this sense individual<br/>autonomy enhancing, and their spirit has guided the relatively thin and ad<br/>hoc range of privacy legislation that has been enacted both nationally and at<br/>the state level.43<br/>
(3) Rules to Enable Choice About Privacy<br/>
The real challenge for privacy, however, is how to enable a meaningful choice<br/>in the digital age. And in this respect, the technique of the American govern-<br/>ment so far—namely, to require text-based privacy policy statements—is a<br/>perfect example of how not to act. Cluttering the web with incomprehensible<br/>words will not empower consumers to make useful choices as they surf the<br/>Web. If anything, it drives consumers away from even attempting to under-<br/>stand what rights they give away as they move from site to site.<br/>
P3P would help in this respect, but only if (1) there were a strong push to<br/>
spread the technology across all areas of the web and (2) the representations<br/>made within the P3P infrastructure were enforceable. Both elements require<br/>legal action to be effected.<br/>
In the first edition of this book, I offered a strategy that would, in my<br/>
view, achieve both (1) and (2): namely, by protecting personal data through a<br/>property right. As with copyright, a privacy property right would create strong<br/>incentives in those who want to use that property to secure the appropriate<br/>consent. That content could then be channeled (through legislation) through<br/>appropriate technologies. But without that consent, the user of the privacy<br/>property would be a privacy pirate. Indeed, many of the same tools that could<br/>protect copyright in this sense could also be used to protect privacy.<br/>
This solution also recognizes what I believe is an important feature of pri-<br/>
vacy—that people value privacy differently.44 It also respects those different<br/>values. It may be extremely important to me not to have my telephone num-<br/>ber easily available; you might not care at all. And as the law’s presumptive<br/>preference is to use a legal device that gives individuals the freedom to be dif-<br/>ferent—meaning the freedom to have and have respected wildly different<br/>subjective values—that suggests the device we use here is property. A property<br/>

privacy<br/>
229<br/>
system is designed precisely to permit differences in value to be respected by<br/>the law. If you won’t sell your Chevy Nova for anything less than $10,000, then<br/>the law will support you.<br/>
The opposite legal entitlement in the American legal tradition is called a<br/>
“liability rule.”45 A liability rule also protects an entitlement, but its protection<br/>is less individual. If you have a resource protected by a liability rule, then I can<br/>take that resource so long as I pay a state-determined price. That price may be<br/>more or less than you value it at. But the point is, I have the right to take that<br/>resource, regardless.<br/>
An example from copyright law might make the point more clearly. A<br/>
derivative right is the right to build upon a copyrighted work. A traditional<br/>example is a translation, or a movie based on a book. The law of copyright<br/>gives the copyright owner a property right over that derivative right. Thus, if<br/>you want to make a movie out of John Grisham’s latest novel, you have to pay<br/>whatever Grisham says. If you don’t, and you make the movie, you’ve violated<br/>Grisham’s rights.<br/>
The same is not true with the derivative rights that composers have. If a<br/>
songwriter authorizes someone to record his song, then anyone else has a<br/>right to record that song, so long as they follow certain procedures and pay a<br/>specified rate. Thus, while Grisham can choose to give only one filmmaker the<br/>right to make a film based on his novel, the Beatles must allow anyone to<br/>record a song a member of the Beatles composed, so long as that person pays.<br/>The derivative right for novels is thus protected by a property rule; the deriv-<br/>ative right for recordings by a liability rule.<br/>
The law has all sorts of reasons for imposing a liability rule rather than a<br/>
property rule. But the general principle is that we should use a property rule,<br/>at least where the “transaction costs” of negotiating are low, and where there<br/>is no contradicting public value.46 And it is my view that, with a technology<br/>like P3P, we could lower transaction costs enough to make a property rule<br/>work. That property rule in turn would reinforce whatever diversity people<br/>had about views about their privacy—permitting some to choose to waive<br/>their rights and others to hold firm.<br/>
There was one more reason I pushed for a property right. In my view, the<br/>
protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a<br/>property right. People need to take ownership of this right, and protect it, and<br/>propertizing is the traditional tool we use to identify and enable protection. If<br/>we could see one fraction of the passion defending privacy that we see defend-<br/>ing copyright, we might make progress in protecting privacy.<br/>
But my proposal for a property right was resoundingly rejected by critics<br/>
whose views I respect.47 I don’t agree with the core of these criticisms. For the<br/>

230<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
reasons powerfully marshaled by Neil Richards, I especially don’t agree with<br/>the claim that there would be a First Amendment problem with propertizing<br/>privacy.48 In any case, William McGeveran suggested an alternative that<br/>reached essentially the same end that I sought, without raising any of the<br/>concerns that most animated the critics.49<br/>
The alternative simply specifies that a representation made by a website<br/>
through the P3P protocol be considered a binding offer, which, if accepted by<br/>someone using the website, becomes an enforceable contract.50 That rule, tied<br/>to a requirement that privacy policies be expressed in a machine-readable<br/>form such as P3P, would both (1) spread P3P and (2) make P3P assertions<br/>effectively law. This would still be weaker than a property rule, for reasons I<br/>will leave to the notes.51 And it may well encourage the shrink-wrap culture,<br/>which raises its own problems. But for my purposes here, this solution is a<br/>useful compromise.<br/>
To illustrate again the dynamic of cyberlaw: We use law (a requirement of<br/>
policies expressed in a certain way, and a contract presumption about those<br/>expressions) to encourage a certain kind of technology (P3P), so that that<br/>technology enables individuals to better achieve in cyberspace what they want.<br/>It is LAW helping CODE to perfect privacy POLICY.<br/>
This is not to say, of course, that we have no protections for privacy. As we<br/>
have seen throughout, there are other laws besides federal, and other regula-<br/>tors besides the law. At times these other regulators may protect privacy better<br/>than law does, but where they don’t, then in my view law is needed.<br/>
PRIVACY COMPARED<br/>
The reader who was dissatisfied with my argument in the last chapter is likely<br/>to begin asking pointed questions. “Didn’t you reject in the last chapter the<br/>very regime you are endorsing here? Didn’t you reject an architecture that<br/>would facilitate perfect sale of intellectual property? Isn’t that what you’ve<br/>created here?”<br/>
The charge is accurate enough. I have endorsed an architecture here that<br/>
is essentially the same architecture I questioned for intellectual property. Both<br/>are regimes for trading information; both make information “like” “real”<br/>property. But with copyright, I argued against a fully privatized property<br/>regime; with privacy, I am arguing in favor of it. What gives?<br/>
The difference is in the underlying values that inform, or that should<br/>
inform, information in each context. In the context of intellectual property,<br/>our bias should be for freedom. Who knows what “information wants”;52<br/>whatever it wants, we should read the bargain that the law strikes with holders<br/>

privacy<br/>
231<br/>
of intellectual property as narrowly as we can. We should take a grudging<br/>attitude to property rights in intellectual property; we should support them<br/>only as much as necessary to build and support information regimes.<br/>
But (at least some kinds of) information about individuals should be<br/>
treated differently. You do not strike a deal with the law about personal or pri-<br/>vate information. The law does not offer you a monopoly right in exchange<br/>for your publication of these facts. That is what is distinct about privacy:<br/>Individuals should be able to control information about themselves. We<br/>should be eager to help them protect that information by giving them the<br/>structures and the rights to do so. We value, or want, our peace. And thus, a<br/>regime that allows us such peace by giving us control over private information<br/>is a regime consonant with public values. It is a regime that public authorities<br/>should support.<br/>
There is a second, perhaps more helpful, way of making the same point.<br/>
Intellectual property, once created, is non-diminishable. The more people<br/>who use it, the more society benefits. The bias in intellectual property is thus,<br/>properly, towards sharing and freedom. Privacy, on the other hand, is dimin-<br/>ishable. The more people who are given license to tread on a person’s privacy,<br/>the less that privacy exists. In this way, privacy is more like real property than<br/>it is like intellectual property. No single person’s trespass may destroy it, but<br/>each incremental trespass diminishes its value by some amount.<br/>
This conclusion is subject to important qualifications, only two of which<br/>
I will describe here.<br/>
The first is that nothing in my regime would give individuals final or<br/>
complete control over the kinds of data they can sell, or the kinds of privacy<br/>they can buy. The P3P regime would in principle enable upstream control of<br/>privacy rights as well as individual control. If we lived, for example, in a<br/>regime that identified individuals based on jurisdiction, then transactions<br/>with the P3P regime could be limited based on the rules for particular juris-<br/>dictions.<br/>
Second, there is no reason such a regime would have to protect all kinds<br/>
of private data, and nothing in the scheme so far tells us what should and<br/>should not be considered “private” information. There may be facts about<br/>yourself that you are not permitted to hide; more important, there may be<br/>claims about yourself that you are not permitted to make (“I am a lawyer,” or,<br/>“Call me, I’m a doctor”). You should not be permitted to engage in fraud or<br/>to do harm to others. This limitation is an analog to fair use in intellectual<br/>property—a limit to the space that privacy may protect.<br/>

CODE 2.0<br/>
I started this chapter by claiming that with privacy the cat is already out of the<br/>bag. We already have architectures that deny individuals control over what<br/>others know about them; the question is what we can do in response.<br/>
My response has been: Look to the code, Luke. We must build into the<br/>
architecture a capacity to enable choice—not choice by humans but by<br/>machines. The architecture must enable machine-to-machine negotiations<br/>about privacy so that individuals can instruct their machines about the pri-<br/>vacy they want to protect.<br/>
But how will we get there? How can this architecture be erected? Individ-<br/>
uals may want cyberspace to protect their privacy, but what would push<br/>cyberspace to build in the necessary architectures?<br/>
Not the market. The power of commerce is not behind any such change.<br/>
Here, the invisible hand would really be invisible. Collective action must be<br/>taken to bend the architectures toward this goal, and collective action is just<br/>what politics is for. Laissez-faire will not cut it.<br/>

THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH IS NOT THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR FREE. IT IS NOT THE<br/>right to free access to television, or the right that people will not hate you for<br/>what you have to say. Strictly speaking—legally speaking—the right to free<br/>speech in the United States means the right to be free from punishment by the<br/>government in retaliation for at least some (probably most) speech. You can-<br/>not be jailed for criticizing the President, though you can be jailed for threat-<br/>ening him; you cannot be fined for promoting segregation, though you will be<br/>shunned if you do. You cannot be stopped from speaking in a public place,<br/>though you can be stopped from speaking with an FM transmitter. Speech in<br/>the United States is protected—in a complex, and at times convoluted, way—<br/>but its constitutional protection is a protection against the government.<br/>
Nevertheless, a constitutional account of free speech that thought only of<br/>
government would be radically incomplete. Two societies could have the same<br/>“First Amendment”—the same protections against government’s wrath—but<br/>if within one dissenters are tolerated while in the other they are shunned, the<br/>two societies would be very different free-speech societies. More than govern-<br/>ment constrains speech, and more than government protects it. A complete<br/>account of this—and any—right must consider the full range of burdens and<br/>protections.<br/>
Consider, for example, the “rights” of the disabled to protection against<br/>
discrimination as each of the four modalities of Chapter 7 construct them. The<br/>law protects the disabled. Social norms don’t. The market provides goods to<br/>help the disabled, but they bear the full cost of that help. And until the law<br/>intervened, architecture did little to help the disabled integrate into society<br/>(think about stairs). The net of these four modalities describes the protection,<br/>or “rights,” that in any particular context the disabled have. Law might intervene<br/>

CODE 2.0<br/>
to strengthen that protection—for example, by regulating architectures so they<br/>better integrate the disabled. But for any given “right,” we can use this mix of<br/>modalities to describe how well (or not) that “right” is protected.<br/>
In the terms of Chapter 7, then, these are modalities of both regulation<br/>
and protection. That is, they can function both as constraints on behavior and<br/>as protections against other constraints. The following figure captures the<br/>point.<br/>
In the center is the object regulated—the pathetic dot from Chapter 7.<br/>
Surrounding the individual now is a shield of protection, the net of<br/>law/norms/market/architecture that limits the constraints these modalities<br/>would otherwise place on the individual. I have not separated the four in the<br/>sphere of the shield because obviously there is no direct match between the<br/>modality of constraint and the modality of protection. When law as protec-<br/>tor conflicts with law as constraint, constitutional law overrides ordinary<br/>law.<br/>
These modalities function together. Some might undercut others, mean-<br/>
ing that the sum of protections might seem to be less significant than the<br/>

free speech<br/>
235<br/>
parts. The “right” to promote the decriminalization of drugs in the present<br/>context of the war on drugs is an example. The law protects your right to<br/>advocate the decriminalization of drugs. The state cannot lock you up if, like<br/>George Soros, you start a campaign for the decriminalization of marijuana or<br/>if, like the Nobel Prize–winning economist Milton Friedman or the federal<br/>judge Richard Posner, you write articles suggesting it. If the First Amendment<br/>means anything, it means that the state cannot criminalize speech about law<br/>reform.<br/>
But that legal protection does not mean that I would suffer no conse-<br/>
quences for promoting legalization of drugs. My hometown neighbors would<br/>be appalled at the idea, and some no doubt would shun me. Nor would the<br/>market necessarily support me. It is essentially impossible to buy time on tel-<br/>evision for a speech advocating such a reform. Television stations have the<br/>right to select their ads (within some limits); mine would most likely be<br/>deemed too controversial.1 Stations also have the FCC—an active combatant<br/>in the war on drugs—looking over their shoulders. And even if I were permit-<br/>ted to advertise, I am not George Soros. I do not have millions to spend on<br/>such a campaign. I might manage a few off-hour spots on a local station, but<br/>I could not afford, for instance, a campaign on the networks during prime<br/>time.<br/>
Finally, architecture wouldn’t protect my speech very well either. In the<br/>
United States at least, there are few places where you can stand before the<br/>public and address them about some matter of public import without most<br/>people thinking you a nut or a nuisance. There is no speakers’ corner in every<br/>city; most towns have no town meeting. “America offline,” in this sense, is<br/>very much like America Online—not designed to give individuals access to a<br/>wide audience to address public matters. Only professionals get to address<br/>Americans on public issues—politicians, scholars, celebrities, journalists, and<br/>activists, most of whom are confined to single issues. The rest of us have a<br/>choice—listen, or be dispatched to the gulag of social lunacy.<br/>
Thus, the effective protection for controversial speech is more condi-<br/>
tional than a view of the law alone would suggest. Put differently, when<br/>more than law is reckoned, the right to be a dissenter is less protected than<br/>it could be.<br/>
Let’s take this example now to cyberspace. How is the “right” to promote<br/>
the legalization of drugs in cyberspace protected? Here too, of course, the law<br/>protects my right of advocacy—at least in the United States. But it is quite<br/>possible that my speech would be illegal elsewhere and that perhaps I could be<br/>prosecuted for uttering such speech in cyberspace “in” another country.<br/>Speech promoting the Nazi Party, for example, is legal in the United States but<br/>

236<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
not in Germany.2 Uttering such speech in cyberspace may make one liable in<br/>German space as well.<br/>
The law therefore is an imperfect protection. Do norms help to protect<br/>
speech? With the relative anonymity of cyberspace and its growing size, norms<br/>do not function well there. Even in cyberspaces where people know each other<br/>well, they are likely to be more tolerant of dissident views when they know (or<br/>believe, or hope) the dissident lives thousands of miles away.<br/>
The market also provides a major protection to speech in cyberspace—<br/>
relative to real space, market constraints on speech in cyberspace are tiny.<br/>Recall how easily Jake Baker became a publisher, with a potential readership<br/>greater than the readership of all law books (like this one) published in the last<br/>decade. Look at the more than 50 million blogs that now enable millions to<br/>express their view of whatever. The low cost of publishing means publishing<br/>is no longer a barrier to speaking. As Eben Moglen asks, “Will there be an<br/>unpublished poet in the 21st Century?”<br/>
But on top of this list of protectors of speech in cyberspace is (once again)<br/>
architecture. Relative anonymity, decentralized distribution, multiple points<br/>of access, no necessary tie to geography, no simple system to identify content,<br/>tools of encryption3—all these features and consequences of the Internet pro-<br/>tocol make it difficult to control speech in cyberspace. The architecture of<br/>cyberspace is the real protector of speech there; it is the real “First Amendment<br/>in cyberspace,” and this First Amendment is no local ordinance.4<br/>
Just think about what this means. For over 60 years the United States has<br/>
been the exporter of a certain political ideology, at its core a conception of free<br/>speech. Many have criticized this conception: Some found it too extreme,<br/>others not extreme enough. Repressive regimes—China, North Korea—<br/>rejected it directly; tolerant regimes—France, Hungary—complained of cul-<br/>tural decay; egalitarian regimes—the Scandinavian countries—puzzled over<br/>how we could think of ourselves as free when only the rich can speak and<br/>pornography is repressed.<br/>
This debate has gone on at the political level for a long time. And yet, as<br/>
if under cover of night, we have now wired these nations with an architecture<br/>of communication that builds within their borders a far stronger First<br/>Amendment than our ideology ever advanced. Nations wake up to find that<br/>their telephone lines are tools of free expression, that e-mail carries news of<br/>their repression far beyond their borders, that images are no longer the<br/>monopoly of state-run television stations but can be transmitted from a sim-<br/>ple modem. We have exported to the world, through the architecture of the<br/>Internet, a First Amendment more extreme in code than our own First<br/>Amendment in law.<br/>

free speech<br/>
237<br/>
This chapter is about the regulation of speech and the protection of<br/>
speech in cyberspace—and therefore also in real space. My aim is to obsess<br/>about the relationship between architecture and the freedom it makes possi-<br/>ble, and about the significance of law in the construction of that architecture.<br/>It is to get you to see how this freedom is built—the constitutional politics in<br/>the architectures of cyberspace.<br/>
I say “politics” because this building is not over. As I have argued (over<br/>
and over again), there is no single architecture for cyberspace; there is no<br/>given or necessary structure to its design. The first-generation Internet might<br/>well have breached walls of control. But there is no reason to believe that<br/>architects of the second generation will do so, or not to expect a second gen-<br/>eration to rebuild control. There is no reason to think, in other words, that<br/>this initial flash of freedom will not be short-lived. And there is certainly no<br/>justification for acting as if it will not.<br/>
We can already see the beginnings of this reconstruction. The architecture<br/>
is being remade to re-regulate what real-space architecture before made reg-<br/>ulable. Already the Net is changing from free to controlled space.<br/>
Some of these steps to re-regulate are inevitable; some shift back is<br/>
unavoidable. Before the change is complete, however, we must understand the<br/>freedoms the Net now provides and determine which freedoms we mean to<br/>preserve.<br/>
And not just preserve. The architecture of the Internet, as it is right now,<br/>
is perhaps the most important model of free speech since the founding. This<br/>model has implications far beyond e-mail and web pages. Two hundred years<br/>after the framers ratified the Constitution, the Net has taught us what the<br/>First Amendment means. If we take this meaning seriously, then the First<br/>Amendment will require a fairly radical restructuring of the architectures of<br/>speech off the Net as well.5<br/>
But all of that is getting ahead of the story. In the balance of this chapter,<br/>
I address four distinct free speech in cyberspace questions. With each, I want<br/>to consider how “free speech” is regulated.<br/>
These stories do not all have the same constitutional significance. But<br/>
they all illustrate the dynamic at the core of the argument of this book—how<br/>technology interacts with law to create policy.<br/>
THE REGULATORS OF SPEECH: PUBLICATION<br/>
Floyd Abrams is one of America’s leading First Amendment lawyers. In 1971<br/>he was a young partner at the law firm of Cahill, Gordon.6 Late in the evening<br/>of Monday, June 14, he received a call from James Goodale, in-house counsel<br/>

238<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
for the <i>New York Times</i>. Goodale asked Abrams, together with Alexander<br/>Bickel, a Yale Law School professor, to defend the <i>New York Times </i>in a lawsuit<br/>that was to be filed the very next day.<br/>
The <i>New York Times </i>had just refused the government’s request that it<br/>
cease all publication of what we now know as the “Pentagon Papers” and<br/>return the source documents to the Department of Defense.7 These papers,<br/>mostly from the Pentagon’s “History of U.S. Decision Making Process on<br/>Vietnam Policy,” evaluated U.S. policy during the Vietnam War.8 Their evalu-<br/>ation was very negative, and their conclusions were devastating. The papers<br/>made the government look extremely bad and made the war seem<br/>unwinnable.<br/>
The papers had been given to the <i>New York Times </i>by someone who did<br/>
think the war was unwinnable; who had worked in the Pentagon and helped<br/>write the report; someone who was not anti-war at first but, over time, had<br/>come to see the impossibility that the Vietnam War was.<br/>
This someone was Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg smuggled one of the 15 copies<br/>
of the papers from a safe at the RAND Corporation to an offsite photocopier.<br/>There, he and a colleague, Anthony Russo, photocopied the papers over a<br/>period of several weeks.9 Ellsberg tried without success to make the papers<br/>public by having them read into the Congressional Record. He eventually<br/>contacted the <i>New York Times </i>reporter Neil Sheehan in the hope that the<br/><i>Times </i>would publish them. Ellsberg knew that this was a criminal act, but for<br/>him the war itself was a criminal act; his aim was to let the American people<br/>see just what kind of a crime it was.<br/>
For two and a half months the <i>Times </i>editors pored over the papers, work-<br/>
ing to verify their authenticity and accuracy. After an extensive review, the edi-<br/>tors determined that they were authentic and resolved to publish the first of<br/>a ten-part series of excerpts and stories on Sunday, June 13, 1971.10<br/>
On Monday afternoon, one day after the first installment appeared, Attor-<br/>
ney General John Mitchell sent a telegraph to the <i>New York Times </i>stating:<br/>
I respectfully request that you publish no further information of this character<br/>
and advise me that you have made arrangements for the return of these docu-<br/>
ments to the Department of Defense.11<br/>
When the <i>Times </i>failed to comply, the government filed papers to enjoin<br/>
the paper from continuing to publish stories and excerpts from the docu-<br/>ments.12<br/>
The government’s claims were simple: These papers contained govern-<br/>
ment secrets; they were stolen from the possession of the government; to<br/>

free speech<br/>
239<br/>
publish them would put many American soldiers at risk and embarrass the<br/>United States in the eyes of the world. This concern about embarrassment was<br/>more than mere vanity: Embarrassment, the government argued, would<br/>weaken our bargaining position in the efforts to negotiate a peace. Because of<br/>the harm that would come from further publication, the Court should step in<br/>to stop it.<br/>
The argument was not unprecedented. Past courts had stopped the pub-<br/>
lication of life-threatening texts, especially in the context of war. As the<br/>Supreme Court said in <i>Near v. Minnesota, </i>for example, “no one would ques-<br/>tion but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting<br/>service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and<br/>location of troops.”13<br/>
Yet the question was not easily resolved. Standing against precedent was<br/>
an increasingly clear command: If the First Amendment meant anything, it<br/>meant that the government generally cannot exercise the power of prior<br/>restraint.14 “Prior restraint” is when the government gets a court to stop pub-<br/>lication of some material, rather than punish the publisher later for what was<br/>illegally published. Such a power is thought to present much greater risks to<br/>a system of free speech.15 Attorney General Mitchell was asking the Court to<br/>exercise this power of prior restraint.<br/>
The Court struggled with the question, but resolved it quickly. It struggled<br/>
because the costs seemed so high,16 but when it resolved the question, it did so<br/>quite squarely against the government. In the Court’s reading, the Constitu-<br/>tion gave the <i>New York Times </i>the right to publish without the threat of prior<br/>restraint.<br/>
The <i>Pentagon Papers </i>is a First Amendment classic—a striking reminder<br/>
of how powerful a constitution can be. But even classics get old. And in a<br/>speech that Abrams gave around the time the first edition to this book was<br/>published, Abrams asked an incredible question: Is the case really important<br/>anymore? Or has technology rendered this protection of the First Amend-<br/>ment unnecessary?<br/>
Abrams’s question was motivated by an obvious point: For the govern-<br/>
ment to succeed in a claim that a printing should be stopped, it must show<br/>“irreparable harm”—harm so significant and irreversible that the Court<br/>must intervene to prevent it.17 But that showing depends on the publica-<br/>tion not occurring—if the Pentagon Papers had already been published<br/>by the <i>Chicago Tribune, </i>the government could have claimed no compelling<br/>interest to stop its publication in the <i>New York Times</i>. When the cat is<br/>already out of the bag, preventing further publication does not return the<br/>cat to the bag.<br/>

240<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
This point is made clear in a case that came after <i>New York Times</i>—a case<br/>
that could have been invented by a law professor. In the late 1970s, the <i>Progres-<br/>sive </i>commissioned an article by Howard Morland about the workings of an<br/>H-bomb. The <i>Progressive </i>first submitted the manuscript to the Department of<br/>Energy, and the government in turn brought an injunction to block its pub-<br/>lication. The government’s claim was compelling: to give to the world the<br/>secrets of how to build a bomb would make it possible for any terrorist to<br/>annihilate any city. On March 26, 1979, Judge Robert Warren of the Western<br/>District of Wisconsin agreed and issued a temporary restraining order enjoin-<br/>ing the <i>Progressive </i>from publishing the article.18<br/>
Unlike the Pentagon Papers case, this case didn’t race to the Supreme<br/>
Court. Instead, it stewed, no doubt in part because the district judge hearing<br/>the case understood the great risk this publication presented. The judge did<br/>stop the publication while he thought through the case. He thought for two<br/>and a half months. The publishers went to the Court of Appeals, and to the<br/>Supreme Court, asking each to hurry the thinking along. No court intervened.<br/>
Until Chuck Hansen, a computer programmer, ran a “Design Your Own<br/>
H-Bomb” contest and circulated an eighteen-page letter in which he detailed<br/>his understanding of how an H-Bomb works. On September 16, 1979, the<br/><i>Press-Connection </i>of Madison, Wisconsin, published the letter. The next day<br/>the government moved to withdraw its case, conceding that it was now moot.<br/>The compelling interest of the government ended once the secret was out.19<br/>
Note what this sequence implies. There is a need for the constitutional<br/>
protection that the Pentagon Papers case represents only because there is a real<br/>constraint on publishing. Publishing requires a publisher, and a publisher<br/>can be punished by the state. But if the essence or facts of the publication are<br/>published elsewhere first, then the need for constitutional protection disap-<br/>pears. Once the piece is published, there is no further legal justification for<br/>suppressing it.<br/>
So, Abrams asks, would the case be important today? Is the constitutional<br/>
protection of the Pentagon Papers case still essential?<br/>
Surprisingly, Floyd Abrams suggests not.20 Today there’s a way to ensure<br/>
that the government never has a compelling interest in asking a court to sup-<br/>press publication. If the <i>New York Times </i>wanted to publish the Pentagon<br/>Papers today, it could ensure that the papers had been previously published<br/>simply by leaking them to a USENET newsgroup, or one of a million blogs.<br/>More quickly than its own newspaper is distributed, the papers would then be<br/>published in millions of places across the world. The need for the constitu-<br/>tional protection would be erased, because the architecture of the system<br/>gives anyone the power to publish quickly and anonymously.<br/>

free speech<br/>
241<br/>
Thus the architecture of the Net, Abrams suggested, eliminates the need<br/>
for the constitutional protection. Even better, Abrams went on, the Net pro-<br/>tects against prior restraint just as the Constitution did—by ensuring that<br/>strong controls on information can no longer be achieved. The Net does what<br/>publication of the Pentagon Papers was designed to do—ensure that the truth<br/>does not remain hidden.<br/>
But there’s a second side to this story.<br/>On July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 fell from the sky ten miles off the south-<br/>
ern coast of Center Moriches, New York. Two hundred and thirty people were<br/>killed. Immediately after the accident the United States launched the (then)<br/>largest investigation of an airplane crash in the history of the National Trans-<br/>portation Safety Board (NTSB), spending $27 million to discover the cause of<br/>the crash, which eventually was determined to have been a mechanical fail-<br/>ure.21<br/>
This was not, however, the view of the Internet. From the beginning, sto-<br/>
ries circulated about “friendly fire”—missiles that were seen to hit the air-<br/>plane. Dozens of eyewitnesses reported that they saw a streaking light shoot<br/>toward the plane just before it went down. There were stories about missile<br/>tests conducted by the Navy seventy miles from the crash site.22 The Net<br/>claimed that there was a cover-up by the U.S. government to hide its involve-<br/>ment in one of the worst civil air disasters in American history.<br/>
The government denied these reports. Yet the more the government<br/>
denied them, the more contrary “evidence” appeared on the Net.23 And then,<br/>as a final straw in the story, there was a report, purportedly by a government<br/>insider, claiming that indeed there was a conspiracy—because evidence sug-<br/>gested that friendly fire had shot down TWA 800.24<br/>
The former press secretary to President John F. Kennedy believed this<br/>
report. In a speech in France, Pierre Salinger announced that his government<br/>was hiding the facts of the case, and that he had the proof.<br/>
I remember this event well. I was talking to a colleague just after I heard<br/>
Salinger’s report. I recounted Salinger’s report to this colleague, a leading con-<br/>stitutional scholar from one of the top American law schools. We both were at<br/>a loss about what to believe. There were cross-cutting intuitions about cred-<br/>ibility. Salinger was no nut, but the story was certainly loony.<br/>
Salinger, it turns out, had been caught by the Net. He had been tricked by<br/>
the flip side of the point Floyd Abrams has made. In a world where everyone<br/>can publish, it is very hard to know what to believe. Publishers are also editors,<br/>and editors make decisions about what to publish—decisions that ordinarily<br/>are driven at least in part by the question, is it true? Statements cannot verify<br/>themselves. We cannot always tell, from a sentence reporting a fact about the<br/>

242<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
world, whether that sentence is true.25 So in addition to our own experience<br/>and knowledge of the world, we must rely on structures of reputation that<br/>build credibility. When something is published, we associate the claim with<br/>the publisher. If the <i>New York Times </i>says that aliens have kidnapped the Pres-<br/>ident, it is viewed differently from a story with the identical words published<br/>in the <i>National Enquirer</i>.<br/>
When a new technology comes along, however, we are likely to lose our<br/>
bearings. This is nothing new. It is said that the word phony comes from the<br/>birth of the telephone—the phony was the con artist who used the phone to<br/>trick people who were familiar with face-to-face communication only. We<br/>should expect the same uncertainty in cyberspace, and expect that it too, at<br/>first, will shake expectations of credibility.<br/>
Abrams’s argument then depends on a feature of the Net that we cannot<br/>
take for granted. If there were credibility on the Net, the importance of the<br/>Pentagon Papers case would indeed be diminished. But if speech on the Net<br/>lacks credibility, the protections of the Constitution again become important.<br/>
“Credibility,” however, is not a quality that is legislated or coded. It comes<br/>
from institutions of trust that help the reader separate reliable from unreliable<br/>sources. Flight 800 thus raises an important question: How can we reestablish<br/>credibility in this space so that it is not lost to the loons?26<br/>
In the first edition of this book, that question could only be answered<br/>
hypothetically. But in the time since, we’ve begun to see an answer to this<br/>question emerge. And the word at the center of that answer is: Blog.<br/>
At this writing, there are more than 50 million weblogs on the Internet.<br/>
There’s no single way to describe what these blogs are. They differ dramati-<br/>cally, and probably most of what gets written there is just crap. But it is wrong<br/>to judge a dynamic by a snapshot. And the structure of authority that this<br/>dynamic is building is something very new.<br/>
At their best, blogs are instances of amateur journalism—where “amateur,”<br/>
again, means not second rate or inferior, but one who does what he does for<br/>the love of the work and not the money. These journalists write about the<br/>world—some from a political perspective, some from the point of view of a<br/>particular interest. But they all triangulate across a range of other writers to<br/>produce an argument, or a report, that adds something new. The ethic of this<br/>space is linking—of pointing, and commenting. And while this linking is not<br/>“fair and balanced,” it does produce a vigorous exchange of ideas.<br/>
These blogs are ranked. Services such as Technorati constantly count the<br/>
blog space, watching who links to whom, and which blogs produce the great-<br/>est credibility. And these rankings contribute to an economy of ideas that<br/>builds a discipline around them. Bloggers get authority from the citation<br/>

free speech<br/>
243<br/>
others give them; that authority attracts attention. It is a new reputation sys-<br/>tem, established not by editors or CEOs of media companies, but by an<br/>extraordinarily diverse range of contributors.<br/>
And in the end, these amateur journalists have an effect. When TWA<br/>
flight 800 fell from the sky, there were theories about conspiracies that were<br/>filtered through no structure of credibility. Today, there are more structures of<br/>credibility. So when Dan Rather produced a letter on CBS’s <i>60 Minutes </i>pur-<br/>porting to establish a certain fraud by the President, it took the blogosphere<br/>24 hours to establish this media company’s evidence was faked. More incred-<br/>ibly, it took CBS almost two weeks to acknowledge what blogs had estab-<br/>lished.27 The collaborative work of the blogs uncovered the truth, and in the<br/>process embarrassed a very powerful media company. But by contrast to the<br/>behavior of that media company, they demonstrated something important<br/>about how the Net had matured.<br/>
This collaboration comes with no guarantees, except the guarantee of a<br/>
process. The most extraordinary collaborative process in the context of con-<br/>tent is Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, created solely by<br/>volunteers. Launched at the beginning of 2001, these (literally thousands of)<br/>volunteers have now created over 2 million articles. There are nine major lan-<br/>guage versions (not including the Klingon version), with about half of the<br/>total articles in English.<br/>
The aim of the Wikipedia is neutrality. The contributors edit, and reedit,<br/>
to frame a piece neutrally. Sometimes that effort fails—particularly controver-<br/>sial topics can’t help but attract fierce conflict. But in the main, the work is an<br/>unbelievable success. With nothing more than the effort of volunteers, the<br/>most used, and perhaps the most useful encyclopedia ever written has been<br/>created through millions of uncoordinated instances of collaboration.<br/>
Wikipedia, however, can’t guarantee its results. It can’t guarantee that, at<br/>
any particular moment, there won’t be errors in its entries. But of course, no<br/>one can make that guarantee. Indeed, in one study that randomly collected<br/>entries from Wikipedia and from <i>Encyclopedia Britannica, </i>there were just as<br/>many errors in <i>Britannica </i>as in Wikipedia.28<br/>
But Wikipedia is open to a certain kind of risk that <i>Britannica </i>is not—<br/>
maliciousness. In May 2005, the entry to an article about John Seigenthaler Sr.<br/>was defaced by a prankster. Because not many people were monitoring the<br/>entry, it took four months before the error was noticed and corrected. Seigen-<br/>thaler wasn’t happy about this. He, understandably, complained that it was the<br/>architecture of Wikipedia that was to blame.<br/>
Wikipedia’s architecture could be different. But the lesson here is not its<br/>
failures. It is instead the extraordinary surprise of Wikipedia’s success. There<br/>

244<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
is an unprecedented collaboration of people from around the world work-<br/>ing to converge upon truth across a wide range of topics. That, in a sense, is<br/>what science does as well. It uses a different kind of “peer review” to police<br/>its results. That “peer review” is no guarantee either—South Koreans, for<br/>example, were quite convinced that one of their leading scientists, Hwang<br/>Woo-Suk, had discovered a technique to clone human stem cells. They<br/>believed it because peer-reviewed journals had reported it. But whether<br/>right to believe it or not, the journals were wrong. Woo-Suk was a fraud, and<br/>he hadn’t cloned stem cells, or anything else worth the attention of the<br/>world.<br/>
Blogs don’t coordinate any collaborative process to truth in the way<br/>
Wikipedia does. In a sense, the votes for any particular position at any partic-<br/>ular moment are always uncounted, while at every moment they are always<br/>tallied on Wikipedia. But even if they’re untallied, readers of blogs learn to tri-<br/>angulate on the truth. Just as with witnesses at an accident (though better,<br/>since these witnesses have reputations), the reader constructs what must be<br/>true from a range of views. Cass Sunstein rightly worries that the norms<br/>among bloggers have not evolved enough to include internal diversity of cita-<br/>tion.29 That may well be true. But whatever the normal reading practice is for<br/>ordinary issues, the diversity of the blogosphere gives readers an extremely<br/>wide range of views to consider when any major issue—such as that which<br/>stung Salinger—emerges. When tied to the maturing reputation system that<br/>constantly tempers influence, this means that it is easier to balance extreme<br/>views with the correction that many voices can build.<br/>
A credibility can thus emerge, that, while not perfect, is at least differently<br/>
encumbered. NBC News must worry about its bottom line, because its report-<br/>ing increasingly responds to it. Blogs don’t have a bottom line. They are—in<br/>the main—amateurs. Reputation constrains both, and the competition<br/>between the two forms of journalism has increasingly improved each. We<br/>have a richer environment for free speech today than five years ago—a com-<br/>mercial press tempered by blogs regulated by a technology of reputation that<br/>guides the reader as much as the writer.<br/>
Errors will remain. Everyone has a favorite example—mine is the ridicu-<br/>
lous story about Al Gore claiming to have “invented the Internet.” The story<br/>originated with a CNN interview on March 9, 1999. In that interview, in<br/>response to a question about what was different about Gore over Bradley,<br/>Gore said the following:<br/>
During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating<br/>
the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives<br/>

free speech<br/>
245<br/>
that have proven to be important to our country’s economic growth and envi-<br/>
ronmental protection, improvements in our educational system.30<br/>
As is clear from the context, Gore is stating not that he invented the tech-<br/>
nology of the Internet, but that he “took the initiative in moving forward a<br/>whole range of initiatives” that have been important to the country. But the<br/>story was retold as the claim that Gore “invented the Internet.” That’s how the<br/>Internet journalist Declan McCullagh repeated it two weeks later: “[T]he vice<br/>president offered up a whopper of a tall tale in which he claimed to have<br/>invented the Internet.” That characterization—plainly false—stuck. In a 2003<br/>study of the media’s handling of the story, Chip Health and Jonathan Bendor<br/>conclude, “We show that the false version of Gore’s statement dominated the<br/>true one in mainstream political discourse by a wide margin. This is a clear<br/>failure in the marketplace of ideas, which we document in detail.”31<br/>
The only redeeming part of this story is that it’s simple to document the<br/>
falsity—because of the Internet. Seth Finkelstein, a programmer and anti-<br/>censorware activist, has created a page on the Internet collecting the original<br/>interview and the subsequent reports about it.32 His is the model of the very<br/>best the Internet could be. That virtue, however, didn’t carry too far beyond<br/>the Internet.<br/>
REGULATIONS OF SPEECH: SPAM AND PORN<br/>
For all our talk about loving free speech, most of us, deep down, wouldn’t<br/>mind a bit of healthy speech regulation, at least in some contexts. Or at least,<br/>more of us would be eager for speech regulation today than would have been<br/>in 1996. This change is because of two categories of speech that have become<br/>the bane of existence to many on the Net: spam and porn.<br/>
By “spam” I mean unsolicited commercial e-mail sent in bulk.“Unsolicited,”<br/>
in the sense that there’s no relationship between the sender and recipient; “com-<br/>mercial” in a sense that excludes political e-mail; “e-mail” in the sense not<br/>restricted to e-mail, but that includes every medium of interaction in cyberspace<br/>(including blogs); and “bulk” meaning many (you pick the number) missives<br/>sent at once.<br/>
By “porn,” I mean not obscenity and not child porn, but what the United<br/>
States Supreme Court calls sexually explicit speech that is “harmful to<br/>minors.”33 This is the category of legally permitted erotic speech—for adults,<br/>at least, not for kids. Obscenity and child porn are permitted to no one.<br/>
These two types of speech—porn and spam—are very different, but they<br/>
are similar in the structure of regulation that each demands. Neither kind of<br/>

246<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
speech should be banned by regulation: There are some who are happy to<br/>receive spam; there are some who are constitutionally entitled to access porn.<br/>But for both kinds of speech, there is a class of individuals who would like the<br/>power to block access to each: most of us with respect to spam; parents with<br/>respect to porn. This is a desire for a kind of “speech regulation.” The question<br/>is how, or whether, the law can support it.<br/>
I’m all for this form of speech regulation, properly architected. “But how,”<br/>
anti-regulation sorts might ask, “can you so easily embrace the idea of regu-<br/>lation? Have you forgotten the important values of free speech?”<br/>
But if the lovers of this form of speech regulation have been reading care-<br/>
fully, they have a quick answer to this charge of censorship. It is clear, upon<br/>reflection, that in the sense of Chapter 7, spam and porn have always been reg-<br/>ulated in real space. The only question for cyberspace is whether the same<br/>effect of those real space regulations can be achieved in cyberspace.<br/>
Real-Space Regulations: Spam and Porn<br/>
Think first about spam in real space. In the sense of Chapter 7, spam, in real<br/>space, is regulated extensively. We can understand that regulation through<br/>the four modalities.<br/>
First law: Regulations against fraud and misrepresentation constrain the<br/>
games bulk mailers can play in real space. Contests are heavily regulated (just<br/>read the disclaimers on the Publishers’ Clearing House Sweepstakes).<br/>
Second, norms regulate bulk mail in real space. There’s a sense of what is<br/>
appropriate to advertise for; advertisement outside that range is almost self-<br/>defeating.<br/>
Third, markets regulate bulk mail in real space. The cost of real space mail<br/>
is high, meaning the returns must be significant before it pays to send bulk<br/>mail. That radically reduces the range of bulk mail that gets sent in real space.<br/>
And finally, architecture regulates bulk mail in real space. We get our mail<br/>
just once a day, and it’s fairly simple to segregate bulk from real. It’s also sim-<br/>ple to dump the bulk without ever even opening it. The burdens of real-space<br/>spam are thus not terribly great.<br/>
These factors together restrict the spread of spam in real space. There is<br/>
less of it than the spammers would like, even if there is more than the rest of<br/>us like. These four constraints thus regulate what gets made.<br/>
A similar story can be told about porn.<br/>Pornography, in real space, is regulated extensively—again not obscenity<br/>
and not child porn, but what the Supreme Court calls sexually explicit speech<br/>that is “harmful to minors.” Obscenity and child porn are regulated too, but<br/>

free speech<br/>
247<br/>
their regulation is different: Obscenity and child porn are banned for all peo-<br/>ple in real space (United States); porn is banned only for children.<br/>
We can also understand porn’s regulation by considering the four modal-<br/>
ities of regulation. All four are directed to a common end: to keep porn away<br/>from kids while (sometimes) ensuring adults’ access to it.<br/>
First, laws do this. Laws in many jurisdictions require that porn not be<br/>
sold to kids.34 Since at least 1968, when the Supreme Court decided <i>Ginsberg<br/>v. New York,</i>35 such regulation has been consistently upheld. States can require<br/>vendors of porn to sell it only to adults; they can also require vendors to check<br/>the ID of buyers.<br/>
But not only laws channel. Social norms do as well. Norms restrict the sale<br/>
of porn generally—society for the most part sneers at consumers of porn, and<br/>this sneer undoubtedly inhibits its sale. Norms also support the policy of<br/>keeping porn away from kids. Porn dealers likely don’t like to think of them-<br/>selves as people who corrupt. Selling porn to kids is universally seen as cor-<br/>rupting, and this is an important constraint on dealers, as on anyone else.<br/>
The market, too, keeps porn away from kids. Porn in real space costs<br/>
money. Kids do not have much money. Because sellers discriminate on the<br/>basis of who can pay, they thus help to discourage children from buying porn.<br/>
But then regulations of law, market, and norms all presuppose another<br/>
regulation that makes the first three possible: the regulation of real-space<br/>architecture. In real space it is hard to hide that you are a child. He can try, but<br/>without any likely success. Thus, because a kid cannot hide his age, and<br/>because porn is largely sold face to face, the architectures of real space make<br/>it relatively cheap for laws and norms to be effective.<br/>
This constellation of regulations in real space has the effect of controlling,<br/>
to an important degree, the distribution of porn to kids. The regulation is not<br/>perfect—any child who really wants the stuff can get it—but regulation does<br/>not need to be perfect to be effective. It is enough that these regulations make<br/>porn generally unavailable.<br/>
Cyberspace Regulations: Spam and Porn<br/>
Spam and porn are regulated differently in cyberspace. That is, these same<br/>four modalities constrain or enable spam and porn differently in cyberspace.<br/>
Let’s begin with porn this time. The first difference is the market. In real<br/>
space porn costs money, but in cyberspace it need not—at least not much. If<br/>you want to distribute one million pictures of “the girl next door” in real<br/>space, it is not unreasonable to say that distribution will cost close to $1 mil-<br/>lion. In cyberspace distribution is practically free. So long as you have access<br/>

248<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
to cyberspace and a scanner, you can scan a picture of “the girl next door” and<br/>then distribute the digital image across USENET to many more than one mil-<br/>lion people for just the cost of an Internet connection.<br/>
With the costs of production so low, a much greater supply of porn is<br/>
produced for cyberspace than for real space. And indeed, a whole category of<br/>porn exists in cyberspace that doesn’t in real space—amateur porn, or porn<br/>produced for noncommercial purposes. That category of supply simply<br/>couldn’t survive in real space.<br/>
And then there is demand. Porn in cyberspace can be accessed—often<br/>
and in many places—for free. Thousands of commercial sites make porn<br/>available for free, as a tease to draw in customers. Even more porn is distrib-<br/>uted in noncommercial contexts, such as USENET, or free porn websites.<br/>Again, this low price translates into much greater demand.<br/>
Much of this supply and demand is for a market that, at least in the<br/>
United States, is constitutionally protected. Adults have a constitutional right<br/>in the United States to access porn, in the sense that the government can do<br/>nothing that burdens (perhaps unreasonably burdens) access to porn. But<br/>there is another market for porn in the United States that is not constitu-<br/>tionally protected. Governments have the right in the United States to block<br/>access by kids to porn.<br/>
As we saw in the previous section, for that regulation to work, however,<br/>
there needs to be a relatively simple way to know who is a kid. But as we’ve<br/>seen throughout this book, this is an architectural feature that cyberspace<br/>doesn’t have. It’s not that kids in cyberspace can easily hide that they are kids.<br/>In cyberspace, there is no fact to disguise. You enter without an identity and<br/>you identify only what you want—and even that can’t be authenticated with<br/>any real confidence. Thus, a kid in cyberspace need not disclose that he is a<br/>kid. And therefore he need not suffer the discriminations applied to a child in<br/>real space. No one needs to know that Jon is Jonny; therefore, the architecture<br/>does not produce the minimal information necessary to make regulation<br/>work.<br/>
The consequence is that regulations that seek selectively to block access to<br/>
kids in cyberspace don’t work, and they don’t work for reasons that are very<br/>different from the reasons they might not work well in real space. In real<br/>space, no doubt, there are sellers who want to break the law or who are not<br/>typically motivated to obey it. But in cyberspace, even if the seller wants to<br/>obey the law, the law can’t be obeyed. The architecture of cyberspace doesn’t<br/>provide the tools to enable the law to be followed.<br/>
A similar story can be told about spam: Spam is an economic activity.<br/>
People send it to make money. The frictions of real space significantly throttle<br/>

free speech<br/>
249<br/>
that desire. The costs of sending spam in real space mean that only projects<br/>expecting a significant return get sent. As I said, even then, laws and norms<br/>add another layer of restriction. But the most significant constraint is cost.<br/>
But the efficiency of communication in cyberspace means that the cost of<br/>
sending spam is radically cheaper, which radically increases the quantity of<br/>spam that it is rational to send. Even if you make only a .01% profit, if the cost<br/>of sending the spam is close to zero, you still make money.<br/>
Thus, as with porn, a different architectural constraint means a radically<br/>
different regulation of behavior. Both porn and spam are reasonably regulated<br/>in real space; in cyberspace, this difference in architecture means neither is<br/>effectively regulated at all.<br/>
And thus the question that began this section: Is there a way to “regulate”<br/>
spam and porn to at least the same level of regulation that both face in real<br/>space?<br/>
Regulating Net-Porn<br/>
Of all the possible speech regulations on the Net (putting copyright to one<br/>side for the moment), the United States Congress has been most eager to reg-<br/>ulate porn. That eagerness, however, has not yet translated into success. Con-<br/>gress has passed two pieces of major legislation. The first was struck down<br/>completely. The second continues to be battered down in its struggle through<br/>the courts.<br/>
The first statute was the product of a scare. Just about the time the Net<br/>
was coming into the popular consciousness, a particularly seedy aspect of the<br/>Net came into view first. This was porn on the Net. This concern became<br/>widespread in the United States early in 1995.36 Its source was an extraordi-<br/>nary rise in the number of ordinary users of the Net, and therefore a rise in<br/>use by kids and an even more extraordinary rise in the availability of what<br/>many call porn on the Net. An extremely controversial (and deeply flawed)<br/>study published in the <i>Georgetown University Law Review </i>reported that the<br/>Net was awash in porn.37 <i>Time </i>ran a cover story about its availability.38 Sena-<br/>tors and congressmen were bombarded with demands to do something to<br/>regulate “cybersmut.”<br/>
Congress responded in 1996 with the Communications Decency Act<br/>
(CDA). A law of extraordinary stupidity, the CDA practically impaled itself on<br/>the First Amendment. The law made it a felony to transmit “indecent” mate-<br/>rial on the Net to a minor or to a place where a minor could observe it. But it<br/>gave speakers on the Net a defense—if they took good-faith, “reasonable,<br/>effective” steps to screen out children, then they could speak “indecently.”39<br/>

250<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
There were at least three problems with the CDA, any one of which<br/>
should have doomed it to well-deserved extinction.40 The first was the scope<br/>of the speech it addressed: “Indecency” is not a category of speech that Con-<br/>gress has the power to regulate (at least not outside the context of broad-<br/>casting.)41 As I have already described, Congress can regulate speech that is<br/>“harmful to minors,” or <i>Ginsberg </i>speech, but that is very different from speech<br/>called “indecent.” Thus, the first strike against the statute was that it reached<br/>too far.<br/>
Strike two was vagueness. The form of the allowable defenses was clear:<br/>
So long as there was an architecture for screening out kids, the speech would<br/>be permitted. But the architectures that existed at the time for screening out<br/>children were relatively crude, and in some cases quite expensive. It was<br/>unclear whether, to satisfy the statute, they had to be extremely effective or just<br/>reasonably effective given the state of the technology. If the former, then the<br/>defenses were no defense at all, because an extremely effective block was<br/>extremely expensive; the cost of a reasonably effective block would not have<br/>been so high.<br/>
Strike three was the government’s own doing. In arguing its case before<br/>
the Supreme Court in 1997, the government did little either to narrow the<br/>scope of the speech being regulated or to expand the scope of the defenses. It<br/>stuck with the hopelessly vague, overbroad definition Congress had given it,<br/>and it displayed a poor understanding of how the technology might have<br/>provided a defense. As the Court considered the case, there seemed to be no<br/>way that an identification system could satisfy the statute without creating an<br/>undue burden on Internet speakers.<br/>
Congress responded quickly by passing a second statute aimed at protect-<br/>
ing kids from porn. This was the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) of<br/>1998.42 This statute was better tailored to the constitutional requirements. It<br/>aimed at regulating speech that was harmful to minors. It allowed commercial<br/>websites to provide such speech so long as the website verified the viewer’s age.<br/>Yet in June 2003, the Supreme Court enjoined enforcement of the statute.43<br/>
Both statutes respond to a legitimate and important concern. Parents<br/>
certainly have the right to protect their kids from this form of speech, and it<br/>is perfectly understandable that Congress would want to help parents secure<br/>this protection.<br/>
But both statutes by Congress are unconstitutional—not, as some suggest,<br/>
because there is no way that Congress could help parents. Instead both are<br/>unconstitutional because the particular way that Congress has tried to help<br/>parents puts more of a burden on legitimate speech (for adults that is) than is<br/>necessary.<br/>

free speech<br/>
251<br/>
In my view, however, there is a perfectly constitutional statute that Con-<br/>
gress could pass that would have an important effect on protecting kids from<br/>porn.<br/>
To see what that statute looks like, we need to step back a bit from the<br/>
CDA and COPA to identify what the legitimate objectives of this speech reg-<br/>ulation would be.<br/>
<i>Ginsberg</i>44 established that there is a class of speech that adults have a<br/>
right to but that children do not. States can regulate that class to ensure that<br/>such speech is channeled to the proper user and blocked from the improper<br/>user.<br/>
Conceptually, for such a regulation can work, two questions must be<br/>
answered:<br/>
1. Is the speaker uttering “regulable” speech—meaning speech “harmful to<br/>
minors”?<br/>
2. Is the listener entitled to consume this speech—meaning is he a minor?<br/>
And with the answers to these questions, the logic of this regulation is:<br/>
IF<br/>
(speech == regulable)<br/>
AND<br/>
(listener == minor)<br/>
THEN<br/>
block access.<br/>
Now between the listener and the speaker, clearly the speaker is in a better<br/>
position to answer question #1. The listener can’t know whether the speech is<br/>harmful to minors until the listener encounters the speech. If the listener is a<br/>minor, then it is too late. And between the listener and the speaker, clearly the<br/>listener is in a better position to answer question #2. On the Internet espe-<br/>cially, it is extremely burdensome for the speaker to certify the age of the lis-<br/>tener. It is the listener who knows his age most cheaply.<br/>
The CDA and COPA placed the burden of answering question #1 on the<br/>
speaker, and #2 on both the speaker and the listener. A speaker had to deter-<br/>mine whether his speech was regulable, and a speaker and a listener had to<br/>cooperate to verify the age of the listener. If the speaker didn’t, and the listener<br/>was a minor, then the speaker was guilty of a felony.<br/>
Real-space law also assigns the burden in exactly the same way. If you want<br/>
to sell porn in New York, you both need to determine whether the content<br/>

252<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
you’re selling is “harmful to minors,” and you need to determine whether the<br/>person you’re selling to is a minor. But real space is importantly different from<br/>cyberspace, at least in the high cost of answering question #2: In real space, the<br/>answer is almost automatic (again, it’s hard for a kid to hide that he’s a kid).<br/>And where the answer is not automatic, there’s a cheap system of identification<br/>(a driver’s license, for example). But in cyberspace, any mandatory system of<br/>identification constitutes a burden both for the speaker and the listener. Even<br/>under COPA, a speaker has to bear the burden of a credit card system, and the<br/>listener has to trust a pornographer with his credit card just to get access to<br/>constitutionally protected speech.<br/>
There’s another feature of the CDA/COPA laws that seems necessary but<br/>
isn’t: They both place the burden of their regulation upon everyone, including<br/>those who have a constitutional right to listen. They require, that is, everyone<br/>to show an ID when it is only kids who can constitutionally be blocked.<br/>
So compare then the burdens of the CDA/COPA to a different regulatory<br/>
scheme: one that placed the burden of question #1 (whether the content is<br/>harmful to minors) on the speaker and placed the burden of question #2<br/>(whether the listener is a minor) on the listener.<br/>
One version of this scheme is simple, obviously ineffective and unfair to<br/>
the speaker: A requirement that a website blocks access with a page that says<br/>“The content on this page is harmful to minors. Click here if you are a minor.”<br/>This scheme places the burden of age identification on the kid. But obviously,<br/>it would have zero effect in actually blocking a kid. And, less obviously, this<br/>scheme would be unfair to speakers. A speaker may well have content that<br/>constitutes material “harmful to minors,” but not everyone who offers such<br/>material should be labeled a pornographer. This transparent block is stigma-<br/>tizing to some, and if a less burdensome system were possible, that stigma<br/>should also render regulation supporting this unconstitutional.<br/>
So what’s an alternative for this scheme that might actually work?<br/>I’m going to demonstrate such a system with a particular example. Once<br/>
you see the example, the general point will be easier to see as well.<br/>
Everyone knows the Apple Macintosh. It, like every modern operating<br/>
system, now allows users to specify “accounts” on a particular machine. I’ve<br/>set one up for my son, Willem (he’s only three, but I want to be prepared).<br/>When I set up Willem’s account, I set it up with “parental controls.” That<br/>means I get to specify precisely what programs he gets to use, and what access<br/>he has to the Internet. The “parental controls” make it (effectively) impossible<br/>to change these specifications. You need the administrator’s password to do<br/>that, and if that’s kept secret, then the universe the kid gets to through the<br/>computer is the universe defined by the access the parent selects.<br/>

free speech<br/>
253<br/>
Imagine one of the programs I could select was a browser with a function<br/>
we could call “kids-mode-browsing” (KMB). That browser would be pro-<br/>grammed to watch on any web page for a particular mark. Let’s call that mark<br/>the “harmful to minors” mark, or &lt;H2M&gt; for short. That mark, or in the lan-<br/>guage of the Web, tag, would bracket any content the speaker believes is harm-<br/>ful to minors, and the KMB browser would then not display any content<br/>bracketed with this &lt;H2M&gt; tag. So, for example, a web page marked up “Blah<br/>blah blah &lt;H2M&gt;block this&lt;/H2M&gt; blah blah blah” would appear on a KMB<br/>screen as: “Blah blah blah blah blah blah.”<br/>
So, if the world of the World Wide Web was marked with &lt;H2M&gt; tags,<br/>
and if browser manufacturers built this &lt;H2M&gt;-filtering function into their<br/>browsers, then parents would be able to configure their machines so their<br/>kids didn’t get access to any content marked &lt;H2M&gt;. The policy objective of<br/>enabling parental control would be achieved with a minimal burden on con-<br/>stitutionally entitled speakers.<br/>
How can we get (much of the) world of the Web to mark its harmful to<br/>
minors content with &lt;H2M&gt; tags?<br/>
This is the role for government. Unlike the CDA or COPA, the regulation<br/>
required to make this system work—to the extent it works, and more on that<br/>below—is simply that speakers mark their content. Speakers would not be<br/>required to block access; speakers would not be required to verify age. All the<br/>speaker would be required to do is to tag content deemed harmful to minors<br/>with the proper tag.<br/>
This tag, moreover, would not be a public marking that a website was a<br/>
porn site. This proposal is not like the (idiotic, imho) proposals that we create<br/>a .sex or .xxx domain for the Internet. People shouldn’t have to locate to a red-<br/>light district just to have adult material on their site. The &lt;H2M&gt; tag instead<br/>would be hidden from the ordinary user—unless that user looks for it, or<br/>wants to block that content him or herself.<br/>
Once the government enacts this law, then browser manufacturers would<br/>
have an incentive to build this (very simple) filtering technology into their<br/>browsers. Indeed, given the open-source Mozilla browser technology—to<br/>which anyone could add anything they wanted—the costs of building this<br/>modified browser are extremely low. And once the government enacts this<br/>law, and browser manufacturers build a browser that recognizes this tag, then<br/>parents have would have as strong a reason to adopt platforms that enable<br/>them to control where their kids go on the Internet.<br/>
Thus, in this solution, the LAW creates an incentive (through penalties for<br/>
noncompliance) for sites with “harmful to minors” material to change their<br/>ARCHITECTURE (by adding &lt;H2M&gt; tags) which creates a MARKET for<br/>

254<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
browser manufacturers (new markets) to add filtering to their code, so that<br/>parents can protect their kids. The only burden created by this solution is on<br/>the speaker; this solution does not burden the rightful consumer of porn at<br/>all. To that consumer, there is no change in the way the Web is experienced,<br/>because without a browser that looks for the &lt;H2M&gt; tag, the tag is invisible<br/>to the consumer.<br/>
<i>But isn’t that burden on the speaker unconstitutional? </i>It’s hard to see why it<br/>
would be, if it is constitutional in real space to tell a speaker he must filter kids<br/>from his content “harmful to minors.” No doubt there’s a burden. But the<br/>question isn’t whether there’s a burden. The constitutional question is whether<br/>there is a less burdensome way to achieve this important state interest.<br/>
<i>But what about foreign sites? Americans can’t regulate what happens in</i><br/>
<i>Russia. </i>Actually, that’s less true than you think. As we’ll see in the next chapter,<br/>there’s much that the U.S. government can do and does to effectively control<br/>what other countries do.<br/>
Still, you might worry that sites in other countries won’t obey American<br/>
law because it’s not likely we’ll send in the Marines to take out a noncomplying<br/>website. That’s certainly true. But to the extent that a parent is concerned about<br/>this, as I already described, there is a market already to enable geographic fil-<br/>tering of content. The same browser that filters on &lt;H2M&gt; could in principle<br/>subscribe to an IP mapping service to enable access to American sites only.<br/>
<i>But won’t kids get around this restriction? </i>Sure, of course some will. But the<br/>
measure of success for legislation (as opposed to missile tracking software) is<br/>not 100 percent. The question the legislature asks is whether the law will make<br/>things better off.45 To substantially block access to &lt;H2M&gt; content would be<br/>a significant improvement, and that would be enough to make the law make<br/>sense.<br/>
<i>But why not simply rely upon filters that parents and libraries install on</i><br/>
<i>their computers? Voluntary filters don’t require any new laws, and they therefore<br/>don’t require any state-sponsored censorship to achieve their ends.</i><br/>
It is this view that I want to work hardest to dislodge, because built within<br/>
it are all the mistakes that a pre-cyberlaw understanding brings to the ques-<br/>tion of regulation in cyberspace.<br/>
First, consider the word “censorship.” What this regulation would do is<br/>
give parents the opportunity to exercise an important choice. Enabling par-<br/>ents to do this has been deemed a compelling state interest. The kids who can’t<br/>get access to this content because their parents exercised this choice might call<br/>it “censorship,” but that isn’t a very useful application of the term. If there is<br/>a legitimate reason to block this form of access, that’s speech regulation.<br/>There’s no reason to call it names.<br/>

free speech<br/>
255<br/>
Second, consider the preference for “voluntary filters.” If voluntary filters<br/>
were to achieve the very same end (blocking H2M speech and only H2M<br/>speech), I’d be all for them. But they don’t. As the ACLU quite powerfully<br/>described (shortly after winning the case that struck down the CDA partly on<br/>the grounds that private filters were a less restrictive means than government<br/>regulation):<br/>
The ashes of the CDA were barely smoldering when the White House called a<br/>
summit meeting to encourage Internet users to self-rate their speech and to<br/>
urge industry leaders to develop and deploy the tools for blocking “inappropri-<br/>
ate speech.” The meeting was “voluntary,” of course: the White House claimed it<br/>
wasn’t holding anyone’s feet to the fire. [But] the ACLU and others . . . were<br/>
genuinely alarmed by the tenor of the White House summit and the unabashed<br/>
enthusiasm for technological fixes that will make it easier to block or render<br/>
invisible controversial speech. . . . [I]t was not any one proposal or announce-<br/>
ment that caused our alarm; rather, it was the failure to examine the longer-term<br/>
implications for the Internet of rating and blocking schemes.46<br/>
The ACLU’s concern is the obvious one: The filters that the market has<br/>
created not only filter much more broadly than the legitimate interest the<br/>state has here—blocking &lt;H2M&gt; speech—they also do so in a totally non-<br/>transparent way. There have been many horror stories of sites being included<br/>in filters for all the wrong reasons (including for simply criticizing the filter).47<br/>And when you are wrongfully blocked by a filter, there’s not much you can do.<br/>The filter is just a particularly effective recommendation list. You can’t sue<br/>Zagat’s just because they steer customers to your competitors.<br/>
My point is not that we should ban filters, or that parents shouldn’t be<br/>
allowed to block more than H2M speech. My point is that if we rely upon pri-<br/>vate action alone, more speech will be blocked than if the government acted<br/>wisely and efficiently.<br/>
And that frames my final criticism: As I’ve argued from the start, our<br/>
focus should be on the liberty to speak, not just on the government’s role in<br/>restricting speech. Thus, between two “solutions” to a particular speech prob-<br/>lem, one that involves the government and suppresses speech narrowly, and<br/>one that doesn’t involve the government but suppresses speech broadly, con-<br/>stitutional values should tilt us to favor the former. First Amendment values<br/>(even if not the First Amendment directly) should lead to favoring a speech<br/>regulation system that is thin and accountable, and in which the govern-<br/>ment’s action or inaction leads only to the suppression of speech the govern-<br/>ment has a legitimate interest in suppressing. Or, put differently, the fact<br/>

256<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
that the government is involved should not <i>necessarily </i>disqualify a solution<br/>as a proper, rights-protective solution.<br/>
The private filters the market has produced so far are both expensive and<br/>
over-inclusive. They block content that is beyond the state’s interest in regu-<br/>lating speech. They are effectively subsidized because there is no less restrictive<br/>alternative.<br/>
Publicly required filters (which are what the &lt;H2M&gt; tag effectively<br/>
enables) are narrowly targeted on the legitimate state interest. And if there is<br/>a dispute about that tag—if for example, a prosecutor says a website with<br/>information about breast cancer must tag the information with an &lt;H2M&gt;<br/>tag—then the website at least has the opportunity to fight that. If that filtering<br/>were in private software, there would be no opportunity to fight it through<br/>legal means. All that free speech activists could then do is write powerful, but<br/>largely invisible, articles like the ACLU’s famous plea.<br/>
It has taken key civil rights organizations too long to recognize this pri-<br/>
vate threat to free-speech values. The tradition of civil rights is focused<br/>directly on government action alone. I would be the last to say that there’s not<br/>great danger from government misbehavior. But there is also danger to free<br/>speech from private misbehavior. An obsessive refusal to even consider the<br/>one threat against the other does not serve the values promoted by the First<br/>Amendment.<br/>
<i>But then what about public filtering technologies, like PICS? Wouldn’t PICS</i><br/>
<i>be a solution that avoided the “secret list problem” you identified?</i><br/>
PICS is an acronym for the World Wide Web Consortium’s Platform for<br/>
Internet Content Selection. We have already seen a relative (actually, a child)<br/>of PICS in the chapter about privacy: P3P. Like PICS, is a protocol for rating<br/>and filtering content on the Net. In the context of privacy, the content was<br/>made up of assertions about privacy practices, and the regime was designed<br/>to help individuals negotiate those practices.<br/>
With online speech the idea is much the same. PICS divides the problem<br/>
of filtering into two parts—labeling (rating content) and then filtering (block-<br/>ing content on the basis of the rating). The idea was that software authors<br/>would compete to write software that could filter according to the ratings;<br/>content providers and rating organizations would compete to rate content.<br/>Users would then pick their filtering software and rating system. If you wanted<br/>the ratings of the Christian Right, for example, you could select its rating sys-<br/>tem; if I wanted the ratings of the Atheist Left, I could select that. By picking<br/>our raters, we would pick the content we wanted the software to filter.<br/>
This regime requires a few assumptions. First, software manufacturers<br/>
would have to write the code necessary to filter the material. (This has already<br/>

free speech<br/>
257<br/>
been done in some major browsers). Second, rating organizations would<br/>actively have to rate the Net. This, of course, would be no simple task; organ-<br/>izations have not risen to the challenge of billions of web pages. Third, organ-<br/>izations that rated the Net in a way that allowed for a simple translation from<br/>one rating system to another would have a competitive advantage over other<br/>raters. They could, for example, sell a rating system to the government of Tai-<br/>wan and then easily develop a slightly different rating system for the “govern-<br/>ment” of IBM.<br/>
If all three assumptions held true, any number of ratings could be applied<br/>
to the Net. As envisioned by its authors, PICS would be neutral among ratings<br/>and neutral among filters; the system would simply provide a language with<br/>which content on the Net could be rated, and with which decisions about<br/>how to use that rated material could be made from machine to machine.48<br/>
Neutrality sounds like a good thing. It sounds like an idea that policymak-<br/>
ers should embrace. Your speech is not my speech; we are both free to speak<br/>and listen as we want. We should establish regimes that protect that freedom,<br/>and PICS seems to be just such a regime.<br/>
But PICS contains more “neutrality” than we might like. PICS is not just<br/>
horizontally neutral—allowing individuals to choose from a range of rating<br/>systems the one he or she wants; PICS is also vertically neutral—allowing the<br/>filter to be imposed at any level in the distributional chain. Most people who<br/>first endorsed the system imagined the PICS filter sitting on a user’s computer,<br/>filtering according to the desires of that individual. But nothing in the design<br/>of PICS prevents organizations that provide access to the Net from filtering<br/>content as well. Filtering can occur at any level in the distributional chain—<br/>the user, the company through which the user gains access, the ISP, or even the<br/>jurisdiction within which the user lives. Nothing in the design of PICS, that is,<br/>requires that such filters announce themselves. Filtering in an architecture<br/>like PICS can be invisible. Indeed, in some of its implementations invisibility<br/>is part of its design.49<br/>
This should set off alarms for those keen to protect First Amendment<br/>
values—even though the protocol is totally private. As a (perhaps) unin-<br/>tended consequence, the PICS regime not only enables nontransparent filter-<br/>ing but, by producing a market in filtering technology, engenders filters for<br/>much more than <i>Ginsberg </i>speech. That, of course, was the ACLU’s legitimate<br/>complaint against the original CDA. But here the market, whose tastes are the<br/>tastes of the community, facilitates the filtering. Built into the filter are the<br/>norms of a community, which are broader than the narrow filter of <i>Ginsberg</i>.<br/>The filtering system can expand as broadly as the users want, or as far<br/>upstream as sources want.<br/>

258<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
The H2M+KMB solution alternative is much narrower. It enables a kind<br/>
of private zoning of speech. But there would be no incentive for speakers to<br/>block out listeners; the incentive of a speaker is to have more, not fewer, listen-<br/>ers. The only requirements to filter out listeners would be those that may con-<br/>stitutionally be imposed—<i>Ginsberg </i>speech requirements. Since they would be<br/>imposed by the state, these requirements could be tested against the Constitu-<br/>tion, and if the state were found to have reached too far, it could be checked.<br/>
The difference between these two solutions, then, is in the generalizability<br/>
of the regimes. The filtering regime would establish an architecture that could<br/>be used to filter any kind of speech, and the desires for filtering then could be<br/>expected to reach beyond a constitutional minimum; the zoning regime<br/>would establish an architecture for blocking that would not have this more<br/>general purpose.<br/>
Which regime should we prefer?<br/>Notice the values implicit in each regime. Both are general solutions to<br/>
particular problems. The filtering regime does not limit itself to <i>Ginsberg<br/></i>speech; it can be used to rate, and filter, any Internet content. And the zoning<br/>regime, in principle, is not limited to zoning only for <i>Ginsberg </i>speech. The<br/>&lt;H2M&gt; kids-ID zoning solution could be used to advance other child protec-<br/>tive schemes. Thus, both have applications far beyond the specifics of porn on<br/>the Net.<br/>
At least in principle. We should be asking, however, what incentives are<br/>
there to extend the solution beyond the problem. And what resistance is there<br/>to such extensions?<br/>
Here we begin to see the important difference between the two regimes.<br/>
When your access is blocked because of a certificate you are holding, you<br/>want to know why. When you are told you cannot enter a certain site, the<br/>claim to exclude is checked at least by the person being excluded. Sometimes<br/>the exclusion is justified, but when it is not, it can be challenged. Zoning,<br/>then, builds into itself a system for its own limitation. A site cannot block<br/>someone from the site without that individual knowing it.50<br/>
Filtering is different. If you cannot see the content, you cannot know<br/>
what is being blocked. Content could be filtered by a PICS filter somewhere<br/>upstream and you would not necessarily know this was happening. Nothing<br/>in the PICS design requires truth in blocking in the way that the zoning solu-<br/>tion does. Thus, upstream filtering becomes easier, less transparent, and less<br/>costly with PICS.<br/>
This effect is even clearer if we take apart the components of the filtering<br/>
process. Recall the two elements of filtering solutions—labeling content, and<br/>then blocking based on that labeling. We might well argue that the labeling is<br/>

free speech<br/>
259<br/>
the more dangerous of the two elements. If content is labeled, then it is pos-<br/>sible to monitor who gets what without even blocking access. That might<br/>well raise greater concerns than blocking, since blocking at least puts the user<br/>on notice.<br/>
These possibilities should trouble us only if we have reason to question<br/>
the value of filtering generally, and upstream filtering in particular. I believe<br/>we do. But I must confess that my concern grows out of yet another latent<br/>ambiguity in our constitutional past.<br/>
There is undeniable value in filtering. We all filter out much more than we<br/>
process, and in general it is better if we can select our filters rather than have<br/>others select them for us. If I read the <i>New York Times </i>rather than the <i>Wall<br/>Street Journal, </i>I am selecting a filter according to my understanding of the val-<br/>ues of both newspapers. Obviously, in any particular case, there cannot be a<br/>problem with this.<br/>
But there is also a value in confronting the unfiltered. We individually<br/>
may want to avoid issues of poverty or of inequality, and so we might prefer<br/>to tune those facts out of our universe. But it would be terrible from the<br/>standpoint of society if citizens could simply tune out problems that were not<br/>theirs, because those same citizens have to select leaders to manage these very<br/>problems.51<br/>
In real space we do not have to worry about this problem too much<br/>
because filtering is usually imperfect. However much I’d like to ignore home-<br/>lessness, I cannot go to my bank without confronting homeless people on<br/>the street; however much I’d like to ignore inequality, I cannot drive to the air-<br/>port without passing through neighborhoods that remind me of how unequal<br/>a nation the United States is. All sorts of issues I’d rather not think about<br/>force themselves on me. They demand my attention in real space, regardless<br/>of my filtering choices.<br/>
Of course, this is not true for everyone. The very rich can cut themselves<br/>
off from what they do not want to see. Think of the butler on a 19th-century<br/>English estate, answering the door and sending away those he thinks should<br/>not trouble his master. Those people lived perfectly filtered lives. And so do<br/>some today.<br/>
But most of us do not. We must confront the problems of others and<br/>
think about issues that affect our society. This exposure makes us better citi-<br/>zens.52 We can better deliberate and vote on issues that affect others if we<br/>have some sense of the problems they face.<br/>
What happens, then, if the imperfections of filtering disappear? What<br/>
happens if everyone can, in effect, have a butler? Would such a world be con-<br/>sistent with the values of the First Amendment?<br/>

260<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Some believe that it would not be. Cass Sunstein, for example, has argued<br/>
quite forcefully that the framers embraced what he calls a “Madisonian” con-<br/>ception of the First Amendment.53 This Madisonian conception rejects the<br/>notion that the mix of speech we see should solely be a function of individual<br/>choice.54 It insists, Sunstein claims, on ensuring that we are exposed to the<br/>range of issues we need to understand if we are to function as citizens. It<br/>therefore would reject any architecture that makes consumer choice trump.<br/>Choice is not a bad circumstance in the Madisonian scheme, but it is not the<br/>end of the matter. Ithiel de Sola Pool makes a very similar point:<br/>
What will it mean if audiences are increasingly fractionated into small groups<br/>
with special interests? What will it mean if the agenda of national fads and con-<br/>
cerns is no longer effectively set by a few mass media to which everyone is<br/>
exposed? Such a trend raises for society the reverse problems from those posed<br/>
by mass conformism. The cohesion and effective functioning of a democratic<br/>
society depends upon some sort of public agora in which everyone participates<br/>
and where all deal with a common agenda of problems, however much they<br/>
may argue over the solutions.55<br/>
On the other side are scholars such as Geoffrey Stone, who insists just as<br/>
strongly that no such paternalistic ideal is found anywhere in the conception<br/>of free speech embraced by our framers.56 The amendment, he says, is merely<br/>concerned with banning state control of private choice. Since enabling private<br/>choice is no problem under this regime, neither is perfect filtering.<br/>
This conflict among brilliant University of Chicago law professors reveals<br/>
another latent ambiguity, and, as with other such ambiguity, I do not think we<br/>get far by appealing to Madison. To use Sunstein against Sunstein, the framers’<br/>First Amendment was an incompletely theorized agreement, and it is better<br/>simply to confess that it did not cover the case of perfect filtering. The framers<br/>couldn’t imagine a PICS-enabled world; they certainly didn’t agree upon the<br/>scope of the First Amendment in such a world. If we are to support one<br/>regime over another, we must do so by asserting the values we want to<br/>embrace rather than claiming they have already been embraced.<br/>
So what values should we choose? In my view, we should not opt for per-<br/>
fect filtering.57 We should not design for the most efficient system of censor-<br/>ing—or at least, we should not do this in a way that allows invisible upstream<br/>filtering. Nor should we opt for perfect filtering so long as the tendency world-<br/>wide is to overfilter speech. If there is speech the government has an interest<br/>in controlling, then let that control be obvious to the users. A political<br/>response is possible only when regulation is transparent.<br/>

Thus, my vote is for the regime that is least transformative of important<br/>
public values. A zoning regime that enables children to self-identify is less<br/>transformative than a filtering regime that in effect requires all speech to be<br/>labeled. A zoning regime is not only less transformative but less enabling (of<br/>other regulation)—it requires the smallest change to the existing architecture<br/>of the Net and does not easily generalize to a far more significant regulation.<br/>
I would opt for a zoning regime even if it required a law and the filtering<br/>
solution required only private choice. If the state is pushing for a change in the<br/>mix of law and architecture, I do not care that it is pushing with law in one<br/>context and with norms in the other. From my perspective, the question is the<br/>result, not the means—does the regime produced by these changes protect<br/>free speech values?<br/>
Others are obsessed with this distinction between law and private action.<br/>
They view regulation by the state as universally suspect and regulation by<br/>private actors as beyond the scope of constitutional review. And, to their<br/>credit, most constitutional law is on their side.<br/>
But as I’ve hinted before, and defend more below, I do not think we<br/>
should get caught up in the lines that lawyers draw. Our question should be<br/>the values we want cyberspace to protect. The lawyers will figure out how.<br/>
The annoying skeptic who keeps noting my “inconsistencies” will like to<br/>
pester me again at this point. In the last chapter, I embraced an architecture<br/>for privacy that is in essence the architecture of PICS. P3P, like PICS, would<br/>enable machine-to-machine negotiation about content. The content of P3P is<br/>rules about privacy practices, and with PICS it is rules about content. But<br/>how, the skeptic asks, can I oppose one yet favor the other?<br/>
The answer is the same as before: The values of speech are different from<br/>
the values of privacy; the control we want to vest over speech is less than the<br/>control we want to vest over privacy. For the same reasons that we disable<br/>some of the control over intellectual property, we should disable some of the<br/>control over speech. A little bit of messiness or friction in the context of<br/>speech is a value, not a cost.<br/>
But are these values different just because I say they are? No. They are only<br/>
different if <i>we </i>say they are different. In real space we treat them as different.<br/>My core argument is that we choose how we want to treat them in cyber-<br/>space.<br/>
Regulating Spam<br/>
Spam is perhaps the most theorized problem on the Net. There are scores of<br/>books addressing how best to deal with the problem. Many of these are filled<br/>

262<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
with ingenious technical ideas for ferreting out spam, from advanced Bayesian<br/>filter techniques to massive redesigns of the e-mail system.<br/>
But what is most astonishing to me as a lawyer (and depressing to me as<br/>
the author of <i>Code</i>) is that practically all of these works ignore one important<br/>tool with which the problem of spam could be addressed: the law. It’s not<br/>that they weigh the value of the law relative to, for example, Bayesian filters or<br/>the latest in heuristic techniques, and conclude it is less valuable than these<br/>other techniques. It’s that they presume the value of the law is zero—as if<br/>spam were a kind of bird flu which lived its own life totally independently of<br/>what humans might want or think.<br/>
This is an extraordinary omission in what is, in effect, a regulatory strat-<br/>
egy. As I have argued throughout this book, the key to good policy in cyber-<br/>space is a proper mix of modalities, not a single silver bullet. The idea that<br/>code alone could fix the problem of spam is silly—code can always be coded<br/>around, and, unless the circumventers are not otherwise incentivized, they<br/>will code around it. The law is a tool to change incentives, and it should be a<br/>tool used here as well.<br/>
Most think the law can’t play a role here because they think spammers will<br/>
be better at evading the law than they are at evading spam filters. But this think-<br/>ing ignores one important fact about spam. “Spam” is not a virus. Or at least,<br/>when talking about “spam,” I’m not talking about viruses. My target in this part<br/>is communication that aims at inducing a commercial transaction. Many of<br/>these transactions are ridiculous—drugs to stop aging, or instant weight loss<br/>pills. Some of these transactions are quite legitimate—special sales of over-<br/>stocked products, or invitations to apply for credit cards. But all of these trans-<br/>actions aim in the end to get something from you: Money. And crucially, if they<br/>aim to get money from you, then there must be someone to whom you are giv-<br/>ing your money. That someone should be the target of regulation.<br/>
So what should that regulation be?<br/>The aim here, as with porn, should be to regulate to the end of assuring<br/>
what we could call “consensual communication.” That is, the only purpose of<br/>the regulation should be to block nonconsensual communication, and enable<br/>consensual communication. I don’t believe that purpose is valid in every<br/>speech context. But in this context—private e-mail, or blogs, with limited<br/>bandwidth resources, with the costs of the speech born by the listener—it is<br/>completely appropriate to regulate to enable individuals to block commercial<br/>communications that they don’t want to receive.<br/>
So how could that be done?<br/>Today, the only modality that has any meaningful effect upon the supply<br/>
of spam is code. Technologists have demonstrated extraordinary talent in<br/>

free speech<br/>
263<br/>
devising techniques to block spam. These techniques are of two sorts—one<br/>which is triggered by the content of the message, and one which is triggered<br/>by the behavior of the sender.<br/>
The technique that is focused upon content is an array of filtering tech-<br/>
nologies designed to figure out what the meaning of the message is. As<br/>Jonathan Zdziarski describes, these techniques have improved dramatically.<br/>While early heuristic filtering techniques had error rates around 1 in 10, cur-<br/>rent Bayesian techniques promise up to 99.5%–99.95% accuracy.58<br/>
But the single most important problem with these techniques is the<br/>
arms race that they produce.59 Spammers have access to the same filters<br/>that network administrators use to block spam—at least if the filters are<br/>heuristic.60 They can therefore play with the message content until it can<br/>defeat the filter. That then requires filter writers to change the filters. Some<br/>do it well; some don’t. The consequence is that the filters are often over and<br/>under inclusive—blocking much more than they should or not blocking<br/>enough.<br/>
The second code-based technique for blocking spam focuses upon the e-<br/>
mail practices of the sender—meaning not the person sending the e-mail,<br/>but the “server” that is forwarding the message to the recipient. A large num-<br/>ber of network vigilantes—by which I mean people acting for the good in the<br/>world without legal regulation—have established lists of good and bad e-mail<br/>servers. These blacklists are compiled by examining the apparent rules the e-<br/>mail server uses in deciding whether to send e-mail. Those servers that don’t<br/>obey the vigilante’s rules end up on a blacklist, and people subscribing to<br/>these blacklists then block any e-mail from those servers.<br/>
This system would be fantastic if there were agreement about how best to<br/>
avoid “misuse” of servers. But there isn’t any such agreement. There are<br/>instead good faith differences among good people about how best to control<br/>spam.61 These differences, however, get quashed by the power of the boycott.<br/>Indeed, in a network, a boycott is especially powerful. If 5 out of 100 recipients<br/>of your e-mail can’t receive it because of the rules your network administrator<br/>adopts for your e-mail server, you can be sure the server’s rules—however sen-<br/>sible—will be changed. And often, there’s no appeal of the decision to be<br/>included on a blacklist. Like the private filtering technologies for porn, there’s<br/>no likely legal remedy for wrongful inclusion on a blacklist. So many types of<br/>e-mail services can’t effectively function because they don’t obey the rules of<br/>the blacklists.<br/>
Now if either or both of these techniques were actually working to stop<br/>
spam, I would accept them. I’m particularly troubled by the process-less block-<br/>ing of blacklists, and I have personally suffered significant embarrassment and<br/>

264<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
costs when e-mail that wasn’t spam was treated as spam. Yet these costs might<br/>be acceptable if the system in general worked.<br/>
But it doesn’t. The quantity of spam continues to increase. The Raducatu<br/>
Group “predicts that by 2007, 70% of all e-mail will be spam.”62 And while<br/>there is evidence that the rate of growth in spam is slowing, there’s no good<br/>evidence the pollution of spam is abating.63 The only federal legislative<br/>response, the CAN-SPAM Act, while preempting many innovative state solu-<br/>tions, is not having any significant effect.64<br/>
Not only are these techniques not blocking spam, they are also blocking<br/>
legitimate bulk e-mail that isn’t—at least from my perspective65—spam. The<br/>most important example is political e-mail. One great virtue of e-mail was that<br/>it would lower the costs of social and political communication. That in turn<br/>would widen the opportunity for political speech. But spam-blocking technolo-<br/>gies have now emerged as a tax on these important forms of social speech. They<br/>have effectively removed a significant promise the Internet originally offered.<br/>
Thus, both because regulation through code alone has failed, and because<br/>
it is actually doing harm to at least one important value that the network<br/>originally served, we should consider alternatives to code regulation alone.<br/>And, once again, the question is, what mix of modalities would best achieve<br/>the legitimate regulatory end?<br/>
Begin with the problem: Why is spam so difficult to manage? The simple<br/>
reason is that it comes unlabeled. There’s no simple way to know that the e-<br/>mail you’ve received is spam without opening the e-mail.<br/>
That’s no accident. Spammers know that if you knew an e-mail was spam,<br/>
you wouldn’t open it. So they do everything possible to make you think the e-<br/>mail you’re receiving is not spam.<br/>
Imagine for a moment that we could fix this problem. Imagine a law that<br/>
required spam to be labeled, and imagine that law worked. I know this is<br/>extremely difficult to imagine, but bear with me for a moment. What would<br/>happen if every spam e-mail came with a specified label in its subject line—<br/>something like [ADV] in the subject line.66<br/>
Well, we know what would happen initially. Everyone (or most of us)<br/>
would either tell our e-mail client or ask our e-mail service to block all e-mail<br/>with [ADV] in the subject line. It would be glorious moment in e-mail his-<br/>tory, a return to the days before spam.<br/>
But the ultimate results of a regulation are not always its initial results.<br/>
And it’s quite clear with this sort of regulation, initial results would be tempo-<br/>rary. If there’s value in unsolicited missives to e-mail inboxes, then this initial<br/>block would be an incentive to find different ways into an inbox. And we can<br/>imagine any number of different ways:<br/>

free speech<br/>
265<br/>
1. Senders could get recipients to opt-into receiving such e-mail. The opt-in would<br/>
change the e-mail from unsolicited to solicited. It would no longer be spam.<br/>
2. Senders could add other tags to the subject line. For example, if this spam were<br/>
travel spam, the tags could be [ADV][Travel]. Then recipients could modify<br/>
their filter to block all ADV traffic except Travel e-mails.<br/>
3. Senders could begin to pay recipients for receiving e-mails. As some have pro-<br/>
posed, the e-mail could come with an attachment worth a penny, or something<br/>
more. Recipients could select to block all ADVs except those carrying cash.<br/>
The key to each of these modified results is that the recipient is now<br/>
receiving commercial e-mail by choice, not by trick. This evolution from the<br/>initial regulation thus encourages more communication, but only by encour-<br/>aging consensual communication. Nonconsensual communication—assum-<br/>ing again the regulation was obeyed—would be (largely) eliminated.<br/>
So in one page, I’ve solved the problem of spam—assuming, that is, that<br/>
the labeling rule is obeyed. But that, of course, is an impossible assumption.<br/>What spammer would comply with this regulation, given the initial effect is to<br/>radically shrink his market?<br/>
To answer this question, begin by returning to the obvious point about<br/>
spam, as opposed to viruses or other malware. Spammers are in the business<br/>to make money. Money-seekers turn out to be relatively easy creatures to reg-<br/>ulate. If the target of regulation is in it for the money, then you can control his<br/>behavior by changing his incentives. If ignoring a regulation costs more than<br/>obeying it, then spammers (on balance) will obey it. Obeying it may mean<br/>changing spamming behavior, or it may mean getting a different job. Either<br/>way, change the economic incentives, and you change spamming behavior.<br/>
So how can you change the incentives of spammers through law? What<br/>
reason is there to believe any spammer would pay attention to the law?<br/>
People ask that question because they realize quite reasonably that gov-<br/>
ernments don’t spend much time prosecuting spammers. Governments have<br/>better things to do (or so they think). So even a law that criminalized spam is<br/>not likely to scare many spammers.<br/>
But what we need here is the kind of creativity in the adaptation of the<br/>
law that coders evince when they build fantastically sophisticated filters for<br/>spam. If law as applied by the government is not likely to change the incen-<br/>tives of spammers, we should find law that is applied in a way that spammers<br/>would fear.<br/>
One such innovation would be a well-regulated bounty system. The law<br/>
would require spam to be marked with a label. That’s the only requirement. But<br/>the penalty for not marking the spam with a label is either state prosecution, or<br/>

266<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
prosecution through a bounty system. The FTC would set a number that it<br/>estimates would recruit a sufficient number of bounty hunters. Those bounty<br/>hunters would then be entitled to the bounty if they’re the first, or within the<br/>first five, to identify a responsible party associated with a noncomplying e-mail.<br/>
But how would a bounty hunter do that? Well, the first thing the bounty<br/>
hunter would do is determine whether the regulation has been complied with.<br/>One part of that answer is simple; the other part, more complex. Whether a<br/>label is attached is simple. Whether the e-mail is commercial e-mail will turn<br/>upon a more complex judgment.<br/>
Once the bounty hunter is convinced the regulation has been breached,<br/>
he or she must then identify a responsible party. And the key here is to follow<br/>an idea Senator John McCain introduced into the only spam legislation Con-<br/>gress has passed to date, the CAN-SPAM Act. That idea is to hold responsible<br/>either the person sending the e-mail, or the entity for which the spam is an<br/>advertisement.<br/>
In 99 percent of the cases, it will be almost impossible to identify the per-<br/>
son sending the spam. The techniques used by spammers to hide that infor-<br/>mation are extremely sophisticated.67<br/>
But the entity for which the spam is an advertisement is a different matter.<br/>
Again, if the spam is going to work, there must be someone to whom I can<br/>give my money. If it is too difficult to give someone my money, then the spam<br/>won’t return the money it needs to pay.<br/>
So how can I track the entity for which the spam is an advertisement?<br/>Here the credit card market would enter to help. Imagine a credit card—<br/>
call it the “bounty hunters’ credit card”—that when verified, was always<br/>declined. But when that credit card was used, a special flag was attached to the<br/>transaction, and the credit card holder would get a report about the entity that<br/>attempted the charge. The sole purpose of this card would be to ferret out and<br/>identify misbehavior. Credit card companies could charge something special<br/>for this card or charge for each use. They should certainly charge to make it<br/>worthwhile for them. But with these credit cards in hand, bounty hunters<br/>could produce useable records about to whom money was intended to be<br/>sent. And with that data, the bounty hunter could make his claim for the<br/>bounty.<br/>
But what’s to stop some malicious sort from setting someone else up?<br/>
Let’s say I hate my competitor, Ajax Cleaners. So I hire a spammer to send out<br/>spam to everyone in California, promoting a special deal at Ajax Cleaners. I set<br/>up an account so Ajax received the money, and then I use my bounty credit<br/>card to nail Ajax. I show up at the FTC to collect my bounty; the FTC issues<br/>a substantial fine to Ajax. Ajax goes out of business.<br/>

free speech<br/>
267<br/>
This is a substantial concern with any bounty system. But it too can be<br/>
dealt with through a careful reckoning of incentives. First, and obviously, the<br/>regulation should make such fraud punishable by death. (Ok, not death, but<br/>by a significant punishment). And second, any person or company charged<br/>with a violation of this spam statute could assert, under oath, that it did not<br/>hire or direct any entity to send spam on its behalf. If such an assertion is<br/>made, then the company would not be liable for any penalty. But the assertion<br/>would include a very substantial penalty if it is proven false—a penalty that<br/>would include forfeiture of both personal and corporate assets. A company<br/>signing such an oath once would likely be given the benefit of the doubt. But<br/>a company or individual signing such an oath more than once would be a tar-<br/>get for investigation by the government. And by this stage, the exposure that<br/>the spammers would be facing would be enough to make spamming a busi-<br/>ness that no longer pays.<br/>
Here again, then, the solution is a mixed modality strategy. A LAW creates<br/>
the incentive for a certain change in the CODE of spam (it now comes<br/>labeled). That law is enforced through a complex set of MARKET and<br/>NORM-based incentives—both the incentive to be a bounty hunter, which is<br/>both financial and normative (people really think spammers are acting badly),<br/>as well as the incentive to produce bounty credit cards. If done right, the mix<br/>of these modalities would change the incentives spammers face. And, if done<br/>right, the change could be enough to drive most spammers into different<br/>businesses.<br/>
Of course there are limits to this strategy. It won’t work well with foreign<br/>
sites. Nor with spammers who have ideological (or pathological) interests.<br/>But these spammers could then be the target of the code-based solutions that<br/>I described at the start. Once the vast majority of commercially rational spam<br/>is eliminated, the outside cases can be dealt with more directly.<br/>
{TXB2}<br/>
This has been a long section, but it makes a couple important points. The first<br/>is a point about perspective: to say whether a regulation “abridg[es] the free-<br/>dom of speech, or of the press” we need a baseline for comparison. The reg-<br/>ulations I describe in this section are designed to restore the effective<br/>regulation of real space. In that sense, in my view, they don’t “abridge” speech.<br/>
Second, these examples show how doing nothing can be worse for free-<br/>
speech values than regulating speech. The consequence of no legal regulation<br/>to channel porn is an explosion of bad code regulation to deal with porn.<br/>The consequence of no effective legal regulation to deal with spam is an<br/>explosion of bad code that has broken e-mail. No law, in other words, some-<br/>times produces bad code. Polk Wagner makes the same point: “[l]aw and soft-<br/>

268<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
ware together define the regulatory condition. Less law does not necessarily<br/>mean more freedom.”68 As code and law are both regulators (even if different<br/>sorts of regulators) we should be avoiding bad regulation of whatever sort.<br/>
Third, these examples evince the mixed modality strategy that regulating<br/>
cyberspace always is. There is no silver bullet—whether East Coast code or<br/>West Coast code. There is instead a mix of techniques—modalities that must<br/>be balanced to achieve a particular regulatory end. That mix must reckon the<br/>interaction among regulators. The question, as Polk Wagner describes it, is for<br/>an equilibrium. But the law has an important role in tweaking that mix to<br/>assure the balance that advances a particular policy.<br/>
Here, by regulating smartly, we could avoid the destructive code-based<br/>
regulation that would fill the regulatory gap. That would, in turn, advance free<br/>speech interests.<br/>
THE REGULATIONS OF SPEECH: FREE CULTURE<br/>
The third context in which to consider the special relevance of cyberspace to<br/>free speech follows directly from Chapter 10. As I describe there, the interac-<br/>tion between the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital<br/>networks produces an explosion of creativity within reach of copyright never<br/>contemplated by any legislature.<br/>
The elements in that change are simple. Copyright law regulates, at a<br/>
minimum, “copies.” Digital networks function by making “copies”: There’s no<br/>way to use a work in a digital environment without making a copy. Thus,<br/>every single use of creative work in a digital environment triggers, in theory<br/>at least, copyright.<br/>
This is a radical change from life in real space. In real space, there are any<br/>
number of ways to “use” a creative work without triggering the law of copy-<br/>right. When you retell a joke to friends, the law of copyright is not invoked—<br/>no “copy” is made, and to friends, no public performance occurs. When you<br/>loan a friend your book, the law of copyright is not triggered. When you read<br/>a book, the law of copyright would never take notice. Practically every single<br/>ordinary use of culture in real space is free of the regulation of copyright.<br/>Copyright targets abnormal uses—such as “publishing” or public perform-<br/>ances.<br/>
The gap between normal and abnormal uses began to close as the tech-<br/>
nologies for “copying” were democratized. Xerox created the first blip; cassette<br/>tape recorders were close behind. But even these technologies were the excep-<br/>tion, never the rule. They raised copyright questions, but they didn’t inject<br/>copyright into the center of ordinary life.<br/>

free speech<br/>
269<br/>
Digital technologies have. As more and more of ordinary life moves onto<br/>
the Internet, more and more of ordinary life is subject to copyright. The func-<br/>tional equivalent to activities from real space that were essentially unregulated<br/>is now subject to copyright’s rule in cyberspace. Creativity activity that never<br/>needed to grapple with copyright regulation must now, to be legal, clear a<br/>whole host of hurdles, some of which, because of the insanely inefficient<br/>property system that copyright is, are technically impossible. A significant<br/>portion of creative activity has now moved from a free culture to a permission<br/>culture. And the question for the values of free speech is whether that<br/>expanded regulation should be allowed to occur unchecked.<br/>
Again, I have my own (overly strong) views about the matter.69 I continue<br/>
to be astonished that a Court so keen to avoid “rais[ing] the costs of being a<br/>producer of sexual materials troubling to the majority”70 is apparently obliv-<br/>ious to the way copyright law raises the costs of being a producer of creative<br/>and critical speech.<br/>
But for our purposes here, we should simply note once again a latent<br/>
ambiguity in our constitutional tradition. As the Supreme Court has held,<br/>the First Amendment imposes important limitations on the scope of copy-<br/>right. Among those are at least the requirements that copyright not regulate<br/>“ideas,” and that copyright be subject to “fair use.”<br/>
But these “traditional First Amendment safeguards” were developed in a<br/>
context in which copyright was the exception, not the rule. We don’t yet have<br/>a tradition in which every single use of creative work is subject to copyright’s<br/>reach. Digital technologies have produced that world. But most of the rest of<br/>the world has not yet woken up to it.<br/>
So what should First Amendment values be in this world? One view is<br/>
that the First Amendment should have no role in this world—beyond the<br/>minimal protections of the “idea/expression” distinction and the require-<br/>ment of “fair use.” In this view, the scope of Congress’s regulation of creative<br/>activities is, subject to these minimal conditions, plenary. Any creative act<br/>reduced to a tangible form could be subject to the monopoly right of copy-<br/>right. And as every creative act in digital context is reduced to a tangible<br/>form, this view means that everything in the digital world could be made<br/>subject to copyright.<br/>
The opposite view rejects this unlimited scope for copyright. While the<br/>
monopoly right of copyright makes sense in certain commercial contexts, or<br/>more broadly, makes sense where it is necessary to “promote . . . progress,”<br/>there is no legitimate reason to burden the vast majority of creative expression<br/>with the burdens of copyright law. That a kid making a video book report<br/>needs to clear permissions with the author of the book, or that friends making<br/>

270<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
a mashup of a favorite artist can’t do so unless the label has granted them per-<br/>mission, extends the reach of copyright beyond any legitimate purpose.<br/>
But between these two views, it is plain that the Framers never made a<br/>
choice. They were never confronted with the option that copyright could<br/>(efficiently) control every single use of a creative work. Any control possible<br/>in 1790 would have been radically too burdensome. And while I have my bets<br/>about how they would vote, given their strong antipathy to monopolies and<br/>the very restrictive IP clause they enacted, that’s nothing more than a bet. If<br/>there’s a choice to be made here, it is a choice they didn’t make. It is instead a<br/>choice that we must make: Whether the values of free speech restrict this rad-<br/>ical increase in the scope of copyright’s regulation.<br/>
THE REGULATORS OF SPEECH: DISTRIBUTION<br/>
So far my arguments about architecture have been about architectures in<br/>cyberspace. In this final story, I blur the borders a bit. I want to use the archi-<br/>tecture of cyberspace to show something important about the regulation of<br/>broadcasting.<br/>
The Federal Communications Commission regulates speech. If I wanted<br/>
to broadcast a political speech on FM radio at a frequency of 98.6 MHz in San<br/>Francisco, the FCC would have me prosecuted.71 To speak on 98.6 in San<br/>Francisco, I need a license, because to speak using these radio frequencies<br/>without a license is a crime. It is a crime despite the fact that the Constitution<br/>says, “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of<br/>the press.” What gives?<br/>
The answer rests on a deeply held assumption at the core of our jurispru-<br/>
dence governing broadcasting technologies: Only a fixed amount of “spec-<br/>trum” is available for broadcasting, and the only way to facilitate broadcasting<br/>using that spectrum is to allocate slices of it to users, who are then the ones<br/>entitled to use their allocated spectrum within a particular geographical<br/>region. Without allocation, there would be chaos, the assumption goes. And<br/>chaos would kill broadcasting.<br/>
This view first came on the constitutional scene after Congress passed<br/>
the Radio Act of 1927.72 In 1926 Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover gave<br/>up the practice of controlling broadcasting after a number of circuit courts<br/>held that he did not have the power to do so. If he did not have the power, he<br/>said, then the invisible hand would have to govern. But Hoover was no real<br/>friend of the invisible hand. He predicted what would happen when he with-<br/>drew federal jurisdiction—chaos—and some suggest his aim was to help<br/>bring about just what he predicted. Stations would override other stations, he<br/>

free speech<br/>
271<br/>
said; broadcasting would be a mess. When some confusion did arise, Hoover<br/>used this to justify new federal regulation. 73<br/>
Congress then rode to the rescue by authorizing the FCC to regulate spec-<br/>
trum in a massively invasive way. Only the licensed could speak; what they<br/>said would be controlled by their license; they had to speak in the public<br/>interest; they had to share their resource with their opponents. In short, Con-<br/>gress said, broadcasting had to be regulated in the same way the Soviet Union<br/>regulated wheat.74 We had no choice. As Justice Felix Frankfurter said in<br/>upholding the regime, such sovietism was compelled by the “nature” of<br/>radio.75<br/>
From the beginning, however, there have been skeptics of this view. Not<br/>
skeptics about the idea that spectrum must be regulated, but about the man-<br/>ner by which it is regulated. Is it really necessary to have a central agency allo-<br/>cate what in effect are property rights? As these skeptics argued, the common<br/>law had done just fine before the federal government entered. It could also do<br/>fine if the government simply made spectrum a kind of tradable property<br/>right. Ronald Coase was most famous for pushing for a regime in which spec-<br/>trum was auctioned rather than licensed.76 And Coase’s idea caught on—fifty<br/>years later. In the United States, the FCC now auctions huge chunks of the<br/>broadcasting spectrum. Just this year, it is positioning itself to sell prime real<br/>estate spectrum—the part that used to broadcast UHF television.<br/>
Now under either scenario—either when the FCC allocates spectrum or<br/>
when it allocates property rights to spectrum—there is a role for the govern-<br/>ment. That role is most extensive when the FCC allocates spectrum: Then the<br/>FCC must decide who should get what. When spectrum is property, the FCC<br/>need only enforce the boundaries that the property right establishes. It is, in<br/>a way, a less troubling form of government action than the government decid-<br/>ing who it likes best.<br/>
Both forms of government regulation, however, produce a “press” (at<br/>
least the press that uses spectrum) that is very different from the “press” at the<br/>founding. In 1791, the “press” was not the <i>New York Times </i>or the <i>Wall Street<br/>Journal</i>. It was not comprised of large organizations of private interests, with<br/>millions of readers associated with each organization. Rather, the press was<br/>much like the Internet today. The cost of a printing press was low, the reader-<br/>ship was slight, the government subsidized its distribution, and anyone<br/>(within reason) could become a publisher. An extraordinary number did.77<br/>
Spectrum licenses and spectrum property, however, produce a very differ-<br/>
ent market. The cost of securing either becomes a barrier to entry. It would be<br/>like a rule requiring a “newspaper license” in order to publish a newspaper. If<br/>that license was expensive, then fewer could publish.78<br/>

272<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Of course, under our First Amendment it would be impossible to imagine<br/>
the government licensing newspapers (at least if that license was expensive<br/>and targeted at the press). That’s because we all have a strong intuition that we<br/>want competition to determine which newspapers can operate, not artificial<br/>governmental barriers. And we all intuitively know that there’s no need for the<br/>government to “rationalize” the newspaper market. People are capable of<br/>choosing among competing newspapers without any help from the govern-<br/>ment.<br/>
So what if the same were true about spectrum? Most of us haven’t any<br/>
clue about how what we call “spectrum” works. The weird sounds and unsta-<br/>ble reception of our FM and AM radios make us think some kind of special<br/>magic happens between the station and receiver. Without that magic, radio<br/>waves would “interfere” with each other. Some special coordination is thought<br/>necessary to avoid such “collision” and the inevitable chaos that would result.<br/>Radio waves, in this view, are delicate invisible airplanes, which need careful<br/>air traffic controllers to make sure disaster doesn’t strike.<br/>
But what most of us think we know about radio is wrong. Radio waves<br/>
aren’t butterflies. They don’t need the protection of the federal bureaucrats to<br/>do their work. And as technology that is totally familiar to everyone using the<br/>Internet demonstrates, there is in fact very little reason for <i>either </i>spectrum-<br/>licenses <i>or </i>spectrum-property. The invisible hand, here, can do all the work.<br/>
To get a clue about how, consider two contexts, at least one of which<br/>
everyone is familiar with. No doubt, radio waves are different from sound<br/>waves. But for our purposes here, the following analogy works.<br/>
Imagine you’re at a party. There are 50 people in the room, and each of<br/>
them is talking. Each is therefore producing sound waves. But though these<br/>many speakers produce different sound waves, we don’t have any trouble lis-<br/>tening to the person speaking next to us. So long as no one starts shouting, we<br/>can manage to hear quite well. More generally, a party (at least early in the<br/>evening) is comprised of smart speakers and listeners who coordinate their<br/>speaking so that most everyone in the room can communicate without any<br/>real trouble.<br/>
Radios could function similarly—if the receiver and transmitter were<br/>
analogously intelligent. Rather than the dumb receivers that ordinary FM or<br/>AM radio relies upon, smart radios could figure out what to listen to and<br/>communicate with just as people at a party learn to focus on the conversation<br/>they’re having.<br/>
The best evidence of this is the second example I offer to dislodge the<br/>
common understanding of how spectrum works. This example is called<br/>“WiFi.” WiFi is the popular name of a particular set of protocols that together<br/>

free speech<br/>
273<br/>
enable computers to “share” bands of unlicensed spectrum. The most popular<br/>of these bands are in the 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz range. WiFi enables a large<br/>number of computers to use that spectrum to communicate.<br/>
Most of the readers of this book have no doubt come across WiFi technol-<br/>
ogy. I see it every day I teach: a room full of students, each with a laptop, the vast<br/>majority on the Internet—doing who knows what. The protocols within each<br/>machine enable them all to “share” a narrow band of spectrum. There is no gov-<br/>ernment or regulator that tells which machine when it can speak, any more<br/>than we need the government to make sure that people can communicate at<br/>cocktail parties.<br/>
These examples are of course small and limited. But there is literally a<br/>
whole industry now devoted to spreading the lesson of this technology as<br/>broadly as possible. Some theorists believe the most efficient use of all spec-<br/>trum would build upon these models—using ultra-wide-band technologies to<br/>maximize the capacity of radio spectrum. But even those who are skeptical of<br/>spectrum utopia are coming to see that our assumptions about how spectrum<br/>must be allocated are driven by ignorance about how spectrum actually<br/>works.<br/>
The clearest example of this false assumption is the set of intuitions we’re<br/>
likely to have about the necessary limitations in spectrum utilization. These<br/>assumptions are reinforced by the idea of spectrum-property. The image we’re<br/>likely to have is of a resource that can be overgrazed. Too many users can clog<br/>the channels, just as too many cattle can overgraze a field.<br/>
Congestion is certainly a possible consequence of spectrum usage. But the<br/>
critical point to recognize—and again, a point that echoes throughout this<br/>book—is that the possibility congestion depends upon the design. WiFi net-<br/>works can certainly become congested. But a different architecture for “shar-<br/>ing” spectrum need not. Indeed, under this design, more users don’t deplete<br/>capacity—they increase it.79<br/>
The key to making this system possible is for every receiver to become a<br/>
node in the spectrum architecture. Users then wouldn’t be just consumers of<br/>someone else’s broadcast. Instead, receivers are now also broadcasters. Just as<br/>peer-to-peer technologies such as BitTorrent harness the bandwidth of users<br/>to share the cost of distributing content, users within a certain mesh-network<br/>architecture for spectrum could actually increase the spectrum capacity of the<br/>network. Under this design, then, the more who use the spectrum, the more<br/>spectrum there is for others to use—producing not a tragedy of the com-<br/>mons, but a comedy of the commons.<br/>
The basic architecture of this mesh system imagines every computer in<br/>
the system is both a receiver and a transmitter. Of course, in one sense, that’s<br/>

274<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
what these machines already are—a computer attached to a WiFi network<br/>both receives transmissions from and sends transmissions to the broadcasting<br/>node. But that architecture is a 1-to-many broadcasting architecture. The<br/>mesh architecture is something different. In a mesh architecture, each radio<br/>can send packets of data to any other radio within the mesh. Or, put differ-<br/>ently, each is a node in the network. And with every new node, the capacity of<br/>the network could increase. In a sense, this is precisely the architecture of<br/>much of the Internet. Machines have addresses; they collect packets addressed<br/>to that machine from the Net.80 Your machine shares the Net with every other<br/>machine, but the Net has a protocol about sharing this commons. Once this<br/>protocol is agreed on, no further regulation is required.<br/>
We don’t have go too deep into the technology to recognize the question<br/>
that I mean this section to pose: If technology makes it possible for radios to<br/>share the spectrum—without either spectrum-licenses or spectrum-prop-<br/>erty—then what justification does the government have for imposing either<br/>burden on the use of spectrum? Or, to link it back to the beginning of this sec-<br/>tion, if spectrum users could share spectrum without any coordination by the<br/>government, why is it any more justified to impose a property system on<br/>spectrum than it is for the government to charge newspapers for the right to<br/>publish?<br/>
No doubt, the architecture that enables sharing is not totally free of gov-<br/>
ernment regulation. The government may well require that only certified<br/>devices be used in this network (as the FCC already does with any device that<br/>can radiate within a range of spectrum). It may push the technology to the<br/>capacity, increasing mesh architecture. It may even reasonably impose nui-<br/>sance-like limits on the power of any transmitter. But beyond these simple<br/>regulations, the government would not try to limit who could use the spec-<br/>trum. It would not ban the use of spectrum for people who hadn’t either<br/>paid or been licensed.<br/>
So here we have two architectures for spectrum—one where spectrum is<br/>
allocated, and one where spectrum (like the market for newspapers) is shared.<br/>Which is more consistent with the First Amendment’s design?<br/>
Here, finally, we have an example of a translation that works. We have a<br/>
choice between an architecture that is the functional equivalent of the archi-<br/>tecture of the American framing and an architecture equivalent to the Soviet<br/>framing. One architecture distributes power and facilitates speech; the other<br/>concentrates power and raises the price of speech. Between these two, the<br/>American framers made a choice. The state was not to be in the business of<br/>licensing speakers either directly or indirectly. Yet that is just the business that<br/>the current rule for spectrum allocation allows.<br/>

free speech<br/>
275<br/>
A faithful reading of the framers’ Constitution, my colleague Yochai Ben-<br/>
kler and I have argued,81 would strike down the regime of spectrum alloca-<br/>tion.82 A faithful reading would reject an architecture that so strongly<br/>concentrates power. The model for speech that the framers embraced was the<br/>model of the Internet—distributed, noncentralized, fully free and diverse. Of<br/>course, we should choose whether we want a faithful reading—translation<br/>does not provide its own normative support. But if fidelity is our aim, this is<br/>its answer.<br/>
SPEECH LESSONS<br/>
What I described at the start of the book as modalities of constraint I have<br/>redescribed in this chapter as modalities of protection. While modalities of<br/>constraint can be used as swords against the individual (powers), modalities<br/>of protection can be used as shields (rights).<br/>
In principle we might think about how the four modalities protect<br/>
speech, but I have focused here on architectures. Which architectures protect<br/>what speech? How does changing an architecture change the kind of speech<br/>being protected?<br/>
I have not tried to be comprehensive. But I have pushed for a view that<br/>
addresses the relationship between architectures and speech globally and uses<br/>constitutional values to think not just about what is permitted given a partic-<br/>ular architecture, but also about which architectures are permitted. Our real-<br/>space constitution should inform the values of our cyberspace constitution. At<br/>the least, it should constrain the state in its efforts to architect cyberspace in<br/>ways that are inconsistent with those values.<br/>

T H I R T E E N<br/>
i n t e r l u d e<br/>
LET’S PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND LOOK BACK OVER THESE THREE CHAPTERS. THERE<br/>is a pattern to the problems they present—a way of understanding how all<br/>three problems are the same.<br/>
In one sense, each has asked: How much control should we allow over<br/>
information, and by whom should this control be exercised? There is a battle<br/>between code that protects intellectual property and fair use; there is a battle<br/>between code that might make a market for privacy and the right to report<br/>facts about individuals regardless of that market; there is a battle between<br/>code that enables perfect filtering of speech and architectures that ensure<br/>some messiness about who gets what. Each case calls for a balance of control.<br/>
My vote in each context may seem to vary. With respect to intellectual<br/>
property, I argue against code that tracks reading and in favor of code that<br/>guarantees a large space for an intellectual commons. In the context of pri-<br/>vacy, I argue in favor of code that enables individual choice—both to encrypt<br/>and to express preferences about what personal data is collected by others.<br/>Code would enable that choice; law could inspire that code. In the context of<br/>free speech, however, I argue against code that would perfectly filter speech—<br/>it is too dangerous, I claim, to allow perfect choice there. Better choice, of<br/>course, is better, so code that would empower better systems of reputation is<br/>good, as is code that would widen the legitimate range of broadcasting.<br/>
The aim in all three contexts is to work against centralized structures of<br/>
choice. In the context of filtering, however, the aim is to work against struc-<br/>tures that are too individualized as well.<br/>
You may ask whether these choices are consistent. I think they are, but it’s<br/>
not important that you agree. You may believe that a different balance makes<br/>sense—more control for intellectual property or filtering perhaps, and less for<br/>
276<br/>

interlude<br/>
277<br/>
privacy. My real interest is in conveying the necessity of such balancing and of<br/>the values implicit in the claim that we will always require a balance. Always<br/>there is a competition between the public and private; always the rights of the<br/>private must be balanced against the interests of the public. Always a choice<br/>must be made about how far each side will be allowed to reach. These ques-<br/>tions are inherent to public law: How will a particular constellation of consti-<br/>tutional values be reckoned? How will a balance be struck in particular factual<br/>contexts?<br/>
I have argued this point while neglecting to specify who is responsible for<br/>
any given imbalance. There are those who would say that there is too much fil-<br/>tering, or not enough privacy, or too much control over intellectual property,<br/>but these are not public concerns unless the government is responsible for<br/>these imbalances. Constitutional value in the United States extends only so far<br/>as state action extends. And I have not shown just how state action extends to<br/>these contexts.<br/>
I do not intend to. In my view, our tradition reveals at least an ambiguity<br/>
about how far constitutional values are to extend. In a world where only gov-<br/>ernments are regulators, keeping the Constitution’s authority limited to state<br/>action makes some sense. But when the modalities of regulation are multi-<br/>plied, there is no reason to ignore the reach of constitutional values. Our<br/>framers made no choice about this; there is no reason why regulation through<br/>code cannot be informed by constitutional values. No argument has been<br/>made for why this part of our life should be cut off from the limitations and<br/>protections traditionally provided by the Constitution.<br/>
Code strikes the balance between individual and collective rights that I<br/>
have highlighted so far. In the next chapter, a different balance is struck—one<br/>again made salient by code. However, this time the balance is not between the<br/>state and the individual but between the state and the implicit regulations of<br/>the architectures of cyberspace. Now the threat is to a traditional sovereignty.<br/>How do we translate that tradition to fit a world where code is law?<br/>

Sovereigns take themselves very seriously—especially sovereigns in cyber-<br/>space. Each has a strong sense of its own domain, and sometimes that sense<br/>translates into dominance in other domains. As more move online, the claims<br/>of one sovereign to control speech or behavior will increasingly conflict with<br/>the claims others sovereigns. That conflict will prove to be the most important<br/>generative fact for the Internet to be.<br/>
I approach the question of this conflict in two steps. The first chapter in<br/>
this Part addresses the question of sovereignty independently of the question<br/>of conflict. What does sovereignty mean? How is it manifest? The next chapter<br/>then focuses upon the particular dynamic that the conflict among sovereigns<br/>will create. That conflict, I argue, will press the architecture of the Internet to<br/>a certain familiar form.<br/>


F O U R T E E N<br/>

VIETNAM IS A COMMUNIST NATION. IT IS ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING COMMUNIST<br/>states, and, of course, its communism is nothing like the communism that<br/>gave birth to the Cold War. But nonetheless, it is a sovereign nation that still<br/>links its identity to Marx and Lenin (through Chairman Ho).<br/>
The United States is not a Communist nation. Defeated by Vietnam, but<br/>
a victor in the Cold War, we are a nation that in large part defines itself in<br/>opposition to the ideology of Marx and Lenin. Vietnam sets the state in serv-<br/>ice of the withering of the state as its ideal; the United States sets the withered<br/>state in the service of liberty as its ideal. Control is the model of communism;<br/>freedom is the model of the United States.<br/>
Or so we are to think.<br/>I confess a certain fascination with Communist states. In the early 1980s<br/>
I wandered through every European Communist state that would let me in. In<br/>the early 1990s, I worked with constitutionalists in Georgia as they drafted<br/>their constitution. And in 1996, I spent much of the summer wandering<br/>through Vietnam. Alone and e-mail-free, I tried to understand this place that<br/>in my childhood fell victim to my nation’s exported struggle with the Cold<br/>War.<br/>
Though I’ve been to many different places around the world, I’ve never<br/>
been to a place more spectacular. One is always overwhelmed by forgiveness,<br/>and an American can’t help being overwhelmed by this nation’s warmth and<br/>welcome. Perhaps had we “won” the war forgiveness would not be so forth-<br/>coming. But it apparently comes easily to those who did win.<br/>
I wasn’t there, however, to understand forgiveness. I wanted to learn<br/>
something about how the place ran. I wanted to understand how this state<br/>exercises control over its citizens; how it continues to regulate; how it qualifies<br/>
281<br/>

282<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
as one of the last remaining Communist states. So I spent time talking to<br/>lawyers, businessmen, and managers of the emerging Net in Vietnam (“Net-<br/>Nam”). Very quickly, a surprising picture emerged.<br/>
Though the ideology of a Communist state admits very little limitation<br/>
on the power of the state; though the Vietnamese state sets as its ideal a com-<br/>mon good rather than the good of individuals or individual liberty; though<br/>on paper there is no “liberty” in Vietnam in the sense that we in the West like<br/>to imagine it—though all this is true, I could not escape the feeling that peo-<br/>ple in Vietnam, in their day-to-day existence, are far less “regulated” than<br/>people in the United States. Not all people, of course: Political opponents<br/>undoubtedly feel the power of the state quite forcefully. But I sensed that<br/>ordinary people in their ordinary lives, many running small shops, had no<br/>conception of the control that government can exercise; no experience of<br/>having their wages reported to a central bureaucracy once a quarter; no<br/>understanding of what it is like to live under the (relative) efficiency of the<br/>regulation we have here. Life there is remarkably free from governmental con-<br/>trol. It was hard to imagine how it would have been different had Nixon won<br/>the war. Pornography was banned and hippies were harassed, but in the main,<br/>people and business got on with very little direct or effective regulation by<br/>government.<br/>
This fact (if you’ll allow random observations of an untrained anthropol-<br/>
ogist to count as fact) is not hard to understand. The “law” on the books in<br/>Vietnam may or may not be a stricter or more extensive regulator than the<br/>“law” in the United States. But the architecture of life in Vietnam clearly<br/>makes any real regulation by the state impossible. There is no infrastructure<br/>of control—there is barely any infrastructure at all. Whatever the regulations<br/>of the state may be, there is no architecture that could make them effective.<br/>Even if there is more regulation there than here (and frankly I doubt that<br/>there is), Vietnam has an effective “freedom.”<br/>
This makes perfect sense. The power to regulate is a function of architec-<br/>
ture as much as of ideology; architectures enable regulation as well as con-<br/>strain it. To understand the power a government might have, we must<br/>understand the architectures within which it governs.<br/>
The preceding chapters have all been about this very point. We can have<br/>
an idea of sovereign power—the power of the sovereign to regulate or control<br/>behavior—but the significance of that power gets realized in a particular con-<br/>text. The state’s power may be “absolute,” but if the architecture does not sup-<br/>port regulation, the state’s effective power is quite slight. On the other hand,<br/>the state’s power may be limited, but if the architectures of control are very<br/>efficient, this limited power can be extraordinarily extensive. To understand a<br/>

sovereignty<br/>
283<br/>
state’s power to regulate we must ask: How well does its infrastructure support<br/>regulation?<br/>
This is the question we should ask about cyberspace, as a first step to<br/>
understanding sovereignty there. What power do sovereigns have to regulate<br/>life in cyberspace? How do the modalities of regulation help or limit that<br/>power?<br/>
We’ll consider this question in three parts, two of which are the subject of<br/>
this chapter. First, what is the nature of the sovereignty in cyberspace? How is<br/>it different from the sovereignty of France? Second, what limits the sover-<br/>eignty of cyberspace? And third, the subject the next section, how will sover-<br/>eigns interact in the regulation of cyberspace, not so much to control behavior<br/>there as to control the effects of that behavior here? How will they compete?<br/>
THE SOVEREIGN OF THE SPACE: RULES<br/>
When you enter the world of MMOG Second Life as a new character, the rules<br/>of Second Life are explained to you. Some of these rules are the techniques you<br/>will need to get around in Second Life—how to move, or how to fly. Some of<br/>the rules are normative commands that tell you what you can and can’t do.<br/>
It is impossible when confronting this introduction not to notice that<br/>
these constraints are constructed. God didn’t make Second Life. No one is<br/>confused about whether he or she did. Nor is it likely that one entering this<br/>space wouldn’t notice that one important dimension to that construction is<br/>construction through code. That you can fly is a choice of the coders. Where<br/>you can fly is a choice of the coders. That when you bump into someone, a<br/>warning box is displaced is a choice of the coders. That you can turn off IM<br/>conversations from people you don’t want to hear from is a choice of the<br/>coders. No one mistakes that there are <i>choices </i>made here. Everyone recognizes<br/>that a critical part of the cyberspace world is made through code. As Second<br/>Life’s CEO, Philip Rosedale, put it to me: “What is God in a virtual world?<br/>Your only God is the code.”1<br/>
Now, as I’ve said from the start, we should distinguish between richly<br/>
controlling spaces and thinly controlling spaces. Spaces like Second Life richly<br/>control the life of people playing there. Indeed, the whole objective of playing<br/>there is create the impression that one is <i>there</i>. These, again, are the sorts of<br/>places I call cyberspace.<br/>
Cyberspace is very different from life on a bill-paying website, or on a site<br/>
holding your e-mail. Code controls these, too. But the control, or sovereignty,<br/>of those sites is distinct from the control of Second Life. In Second Life, or in<br/>what I’ve defined to be cyberspace generally, the control is ubiquitous; on a<br/>

284<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
bill-paying website, or on what I’ve called the Internet, the control is passing,<br/>transitory.<br/>
Interestingly, there is an important dynamic shift that we’ve already iden-<br/>
tified, more in thinly controlling spaces than thick. This is the preference for<br/>code controls where code controls are possible.<br/>
Think again about the bill-paying website. It is of course against the law<br/>
to access someone’s bank account and transfer funds from that account with-<br/>out the authorization of the account owner. But no bank would ever simply<br/>rely upon the law to enforce that rule. Every bank adds a complex set of code<br/>to authenticate who you are when you enter a bill-paying website. Where a<br/>policy objective can be coded, then the only limit on that coding is the mar-<br/>ginal cost of code versus the marginal benefit of the added control.<br/>
But in a thickly controlling environment such as Second Life, there’s a<br/>
limit to the use of code to guide social behavior. Sometimes, in other words,<br/>better code can weaken community. As Second Life’s Rosedale put it,<br/>
In some ways the difficulty of Second Life is a benefit because you have to be<br/>
taught. And that Act of being taught is such a huge win for both the teacher and<br/>
the student. . . . [We] have this sort of mentoring going on that is such a psycho-<br/>
logically appealing relationship—one which the real world doesn’t give us very<br/>
much.2<br/>
A second way in which better code can weaken community is even more<br/>
important. As Second Life is, it doesn’t enable people easily to segregate. As<br/>Rosedale described,<br/>
In Second Life, there’s basically not any zoning. What this means is that neighbor<br/>
disputes are frequent. But from the standpoint of learning, this is actually a real<br/>
positive. I’ve gotten e-mail from people that says, “Well, I didn’t get along with<br/>
my neighbors, and as a result, I learned very rapidly a great deal about how to<br/>
resolve disputes. How to be a good neighbor.” . . . [I]n the real world . . . there so<br/>
much law . . . that you don’t actually have to talk to your neighbors. [Instead]<br/>
there’s simply a law that says you can or can’t do [something.] . . . There’s an<br/>
opportunity to communicate and interact [in the virtual world] in a way that the<br/>
real world offers only under very rare circumstances.3<br/>
The code thus doesn’t simply make all problems go away. It doesn’t<br/>
remove the need for neighbors to work stuff out. And in this way, the code<br/>helps build community. The practice of interaction builds bonds that would<br/>not be built if the code produced the same results, automatically. Optimal<br/>

sovereignty<br/>
285<br/>
design leaves certain problems to the players to work out—not because the<br/>solution couldn’t be coded, but also because coding a solution would have col-<br/>lateral costs.<br/>
Nonetheless, it is still the sovereign in these virtual spaces that chooses<br/>
one modality over another. The trade-off is complicated. Perfect efficiency of<br/>results is not always perfectly efficient. But still the choice of means remains.<br/>
THE SOVEREIGN OF THE SPACE: CHOOSING RULES<br/>
But how is that choice made? Or more directly, what about democracy? In real<br/>space, the rule is that sovereigns are legitimate only if democratic. We barely<br/>tolerate (most) nondemocratic regimes. The general norm for real space life<br/>is that ultimately, the people rule.<br/>
But the single most interesting nondevelopment in cyberspace is that,<br/>
again, as Castronova puts it, “one does not find much democracy at all in<br/>synthetic worlds.”4 The one real exception is a world called “A Tale in the<br/>Desert.”5 Democracy has not broken out across cyberspace, or on the Internet.<br/>Instead, democracy is a rare exception to a fairly strong rule—that the<br/>“owner” of the space is the sovereign. And in Castronova’s view, the owner is<br/>not ordinarily a very good sovereign:<br/>
In sum, none of the worlds, to my knowledge, has ever evolved institutions of<br/>
good government. Anarchy reigns in all worlds.6<br/>
This isn’t to say that aggregated views don’t matter in cyberspace. Indeed,<br/>
they are crucial to central aspects of the Internet as it is just now. A kind of<br/>voting—as manifested through links—guides search engines. Technorati, as<br/>I’ve already described, relies upon the same to rank blogs. And important<br/>sites, such as Slashdot, routinely use rankings or votes of editors to determine<br/>which comments will rise to the top.<br/>
These are all democracy-like. But they are not democracy. Democracy is<br/>
the practice of the people choosing the rules that will govern a particular<br/>place. And with the exception of Wikipedia, and “A Tale in the Desert,” there<br/>are very few major Internet or cyberspace institutions that run by the rule of<br/>the people.<br/>
So what explains this democracy gap? And should we expect it to change?<br/>Our history of self-government has a particular form, with two impor-<br/>
tantly contingent features. Before our founding, life was geographically<br/>based—a nation was a society located in a physical space, with a single sover-<br/>eign allegiance. As we’ll consider more extensively in the chapter that follows,<br/>

286<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
the conceptual revolution of the American Republic was that citizens could<br/>have two sovereigns—more precisely, that they (as the ultimate sovereign)<br/>could vest their sovereign power in two different delegates. Their state govern-<br/>ment was one delegate, the federal government was another; individuals living<br/>in a single geographic location could thus be citizens of both governments.<br/>That was the idea of the founding document, and the Fourteenth Amendment<br/>made it explicit: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and<br/>subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the<br/>State wherein they reside.”<br/>
Citizenship in this sense did not always mean a right to contribute to the<br/>
self-government of whatever community you were a citizen of.7 Even today<br/>there are citizens that have no right to vote—e.g., children. But for those rec-<br/>ognized as members of civil and political society, citizenship is an entitlement:<br/>It is a right to participate in the governing of the political community of<br/>which they are members. As a citizen of the United States, I have the right to<br/>vote in U.S. elections; as a citizen of California, I have the right to vote in<br/>California elections. I have both rights at the same time.<br/>
At this level, the link between entitlement and geography makes sense.<br/>
But as mobility has increased, the at-one-time obvious link between geogra-<br/>phy and citizenship has become less and less obvious. I live in San Francisco,<br/>but I work in Palo Alto. The rules give me full participation rights in San<br/>Francisco but none in Palo Alto. Why does this make sense?<br/>
Political theorists have noted this problem for some time.8 Scholars such<br/>
as Richard Ford and Lani Guinier have developed powerful alternative con-<br/>ceptions of self-government that would enable a kind of self-government not<br/>tied directly to geography. With one such alternative, voters choose (within<br/>limits) the community where their votes count. Thus if I felt participating in<br/>the future of Palo Alto was more important than participating in the future of<br/>San Francisco, I would have the right to vote in Palo Alto though I lived in San<br/>Francisco.<br/>
These complications are magnified when we consider the link between<br/>
geography and cyberspace. Even if I should have the right to vote in the com-<br/>munity where I work, should I have the right to vote in the community where<br/>I play? Why would real-space citizens need to have any control over cyber-<br/>places or their architectures? You might spend most of your life in a mall, but<br/>no one would say you have a right to control the mall’s architecture. Or you<br/>might like to visit Disney World every weekend, but it would be odd to claim<br/>that you therefore have a right to regulate Disney World. Why isn’t cyberspace<br/>more like a mall or a theme park than like the district in which you live and<br/>vote?<br/>

sovereignty<br/>

Your relationship to a mall, or to Disney World, is the relationship of<br/>
consumer to merchant. If you don’t like two-all-beef-patties-special-sauce-<br/>lettuce-cheese-pickles-onions-on-a-sesa-me-seed-bun, then you can go to<br/>Burger King; McDonald’s has no duty to let you vote on how it makes its<br/>hamburgers. If you don’t like the local mall, you can go to another. The power<br/>you have over these institutions is your ability to exit. They compete for your<br/>attention, your custom, and your loyalty; if they compete well, you will give<br/>them your custom; if they don’t, you will go somewhere else. That competi-<br/>tion is crucial in disciplining these institutions. What makes them work well<br/>is this competition among these potential sources for your custom.<br/>
This merchant-sovereign part of our life is important. It is where we spend<br/>
most of our time, and most people are more satisfied with this part of their<br/>lives than they are with the part within which they get to vote. In this sense, all<br/>these places are sovereigns; they all impose rules on us. But our recourse with<br/>respect to merchant-sovereigns is simply to take our business elsewhere.<br/>
But the merchant-sovereign part of our life is not exclusive. There are<br/>
also citizen-sovereign parts of our life. There are no states that get to say to<br/>their citizens: “You have no right to vote here; if you don’t like it, leave.” Our<br/>role in relation to our governments is that of a stakeholder with a voice. We<br/>have a right—if the government is to be called democratic—to participate in<br/>its structuring.<br/>
And this is true not just with governments. It would be an odd university<br/>
that gave its faculty no right to vote on issues central to the university (though<br/>it is an odd corporation that gives its employees a right to vote on issues<br/>related to employment). It would be an odd social club that did not give<br/>members some control over its functions—though again, there are such clubs,<br/>just as there are nondemocratic governments. Even the church allows its<br/>members to determine a great deal of how members are governed. In these<br/>institutions, we are members, not consumers—or, not just consumers. These<br/>institutions give consumers control over the rules that will govern them. In<br/>this sense, these institutions are citizen-sovereignties.<br/>
As a descriptive matter, then, cyberspace is not yet dominated (or even<br/>
broadly populated) by citizen-sovereignties. The sovereignties we see so far are<br/>all merchant-sovereignties. And this is even more clearly true with the Inter-<br/>net. To the extent sites are sovereign, they are merchant-sovereigns. Our rela-<br/>tionship to them is the same as our relationship to McDonald’s.<br/>
Some theorists have tried to collapse these two different models into one.<br/>
Some have tried to carry the member model into every sphere of social life—<br/>the workplace, the mall, the local pub.9 Others have tried to carry the con-<br/>sumer model into every sphere of social life—followers of Charles Tiebout,<br/>

288<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
for example, have tried to explain competition among governments along<br/>the lines of the choices we make among toothpastes.10 But even if we cannot<br/>articulate perfectly the justifications for treating these choices differently, it<br/>would be a mistake to collapse these different spheres into one. It would be<br/>hell to have to vote on the design of toothpaste, and tyranny if our only<br/>recourse against a government we didn’t like was to move to a different land.<br/>
But then is it a problem that cyberspace is comprised of just merchant-<br/>
sovereignties? The first defense for merchant-sovereignties is developed in<br/>the writings of David Post and his sometime coauthor David Johnson.11<br/>Post’s article “Anarchy, State, and the Internet” best sets the stage. Communi-<br/>ties in cyberspace, Post argues, are governed by “rule-sets.” We can understand<br/>these rule-sets to be the requirements, whether embedded in the architecture<br/>or promulgated in a set of rules, that constrain behavior in a particular place.<br/>The world of cyberspace, he argues, is comprised by these rule-sets. Individ-<br/>uals will choose to enter one rule-set or another. As rule-sets compete for our<br/>attention, the world of cyberspace will come to be defined by this competition<br/>of merchant-sovereigns for customers.<br/>
Post’s account again is descriptively accurate. It is also, Post argues, nor-<br/>
matively recommended. Sovereigns should be understand as a firm’s market<br/>power is understood in antitrust law. By “market power” antitrust lawyers<br/>and economists mean a firm’s ability to raise prices profitably. In a perfectly<br/>competitive market, a firm with no market power is the one that cannot raise<br/>its prices because it would lose so much in sales as to make the increase not<br/>worth it.12 The firm that does have market power can raise prices and see its<br/>profits increase. The firm with market power also has the ability to force con-<br/>sumers to accept a price for a good that is higher than the price in a compet-<br/>itive market.<br/>
We might imagine an analogous constraint operating on government.<br/>
Sovereigns, like firms, can get away with only so much. As they become more<br/>repressive, or as they regulate more harshly, other sovereigns, or other rule-<br/>sets, become competitors. At some point it is easier for citizens to leave than<br/>to put up with the burdens of regulation,13 or easier to evade the law than to<br/>comply with it.<br/>
Because such moves are costly in real space, sovereigns, at least in the<br/>
short run, can get away with a lot. But in cyberspace, moving is not so hard.<br/>If you do not like the rule-set of your MMOGs, you can change games. If<br/>you do not like the amount of advertising on one Internet portal, then in two<br/>seconds you can change your default portal. Life in cyberspace is about join-<br/>ing without ever leaving your home. If the group you join does not treat you<br/>as you want to be treated, you can leave. Because competitive pressure is<br/>

sovereignty<br/>
289<br/>
greater in cyberspace, governments and other propagators of rule-sets must<br/>behave like firms in a competitive market.<br/>
This is an important and interesting conception of governance. Impor-<br/>
tant because it describes governance in cyberspace; interesting because it per-<br/>haps shows the purpose and limits of citizen-sovereignty in real space. It<br/>argues for a world of volunteers, one where rules are not imposed but selected.<br/>It is a world that minimizes the unconcented-to-power of any particular gov-<br/>ernment, by making governments competitors for citizens. It is government<br/>like McDonald’s or Coca-Cola—eager to please, fearful of revolt.<br/>
There are reasons, however, to be skeptical about this view. First, consider<br/>
the claim that exit costs are lower in cyberspace than in real space. When you<br/>switch to a different ISP or Internet portal, you no doubt confront a different<br/>set of “rules,” and these rules no doubt compete for your attention. This is just<br/>like going from one restaurant or shopping mall to another. There are com-<br/>peting rule-sets; they are among several factors you consider in choosing an<br/>ISP; and to the extent that there is easy movement among these rule-sets, this<br/>movement is undoubtedly a competition among them. Some ISPs, of course,<br/>try to make this movement difficult. If you’ve been a member of AOL for ten<br/>years, and you decide you want to switch, AOL doesn’t make that change easy<br/>by providing, for example, a simple ability to forward your e-mail. But as<br/>people recognize this restriction imposed by AOL, they’ll choose other ISPs.<br/>If the competition is real, the rule-set will compete.<br/>
Communities, however, are different. Consider the “competition” among,<br/>
say, MMOGs. You join an MMOG and spend months building a character in<br/>that community. You also collect assets—buildings you’ve built, or weapons<br/>you’ve acquired. Both resources are a kind of capital. The set of relationships<br/>you’ve developed are the social capital; all the stuff you have is the physical<br/>capital.<br/>
If you then become dissatisfied with life in your chosen MMOGs, you can<br/>
leave. But leaving is costly. You can’t transfer the social capital you’ve built,<br/>and, depending upon the game, you may not be able to transfer the physical<br/>capital either. Like choosing to join a different frequent flyer program, the<br/>choice to join a different MMOG is a decision to waste certain assets. And that<br/>fact will weaken the competition among these rule-sets.<br/>
I don’t mean to overstate the point. Indeed, as markets have developed<br/>
for selling assets within MMOGs, and the nature of the games has become<br/>standardized, some argue that it is becoming much easier to move from one<br/>game to another. In real space you also can’t easily transfer social capital<br/>from one community to another. Friends are not fungible, even if they can<br/>give you connections at your new home. But physical assets in real space are<br/>

290<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
transferable. I can sell what I don’t want and move what I do. Always. In<br/>MMOGs, not always.<br/>
Paradoxically, then, we might say that it may be harder to change commu-<br/>
nities in cyberspace than it is in real space. It is harder because you must give<br/>up everything in a move from one cyber-community to another, whereas in<br/>real space you can bring much of it with you.14 Communities in cyberspace<br/>may in the short run have more power over their citizens (regarding social<br/>capital) than real-space communities do.<br/>
This means that the picture of competing rule-sets in cyberspace is more<br/>
complex than Post suggests. The pressure on competition is potentially greater<br/>in turn. That might motivate a desire in cyberspace communities to shift<br/>toward citizen-sovereignty, but, again, there’s not much evidence of that shift<br/>yet.<br/>
There is a second, more fundamental skepticism. Even if we could con-<br/>
struct cyberspace on the model of the market—so that we relate to spaces in<br/>cyberspace the way we relate to toothpaste in real space—there are strong<br/>reasons not to. As life moves online, and more and more citizens from states<br/>X, Y, and Z come to interact in cyberspaces A, B, and C, these cyberspaces<br/>may well need to develop the kind of responsibility and attention that devel-<br/>ops (ideally) within a democracy. Or, put differently, if cyberspace wants to<br/>be considered its own legitimate sovereign, and thus deserving of some<br/>measure of independence and respect, it must become more clearly a citizen-<br/>sovereignty.<br/>
This same dynamic happens in real space. There are many institutions<br/>
that are not “sovereign” in the sense that they control how people live, but are<br/>“sovereign” in the sense that within the institution, they control how people<br/>behave. Universities, social clubs, churches, and corporations are the obvious<br/>examples of institutions that gain a kind of autonomy from ordinary govern-<br/>ment. This autonomy can be thick or thin. And my suggestion is that it gets<br/>thicker the more the institution reflects values of citizen-sovereignty.<br/>
This kind of sovereignty is expressed in the law through doctrines of<br/>
immunity. A corporation has certain immunities, but that depends upon it<br/>fitting a particular corporate form. Churches have a certain immunity, but it<br/>is increasingly challenged as its governance becomes more alien.<br/>
Communities in cyberspace will earn a similar immunity more quickly if<br/>
they reflect citizen-sovereign values rather than merchant-sovereign values.<br/>The more responsible the communities become, the more likely real-space<br/>governments will defer to their norms through doctrines like immunity.<br/>
This maturation—if it is that—is obviously a long way down the road. It<br/>
depends upon an increasing self-recognition by members of these cyberspace<br/>

sovereignty<br/>
291<br/>
communities that they are, in a sense, separate, or complementary communi-<br/>ties. It depends upon an increasing recognition among noncommunity mem-<br/>bers that there’s something distinctive about these communities. Some are<br/>optimistic that this will happen. As Dan Hunter and Greg Lastowka write:<br/>
Courts will need to recognize that virtual worlds are jurisdictions separate from<br/>
our own, with their own distinctive community norms, laws, and rights. While<br/>
cyborg inhabitants will demand that these rights be recognized by real-world<br/>
courts and virtual-world wizards, they will need to arrive at these rights them-<br/>
selves within the context of the virtual worlds.15<br/>
We’ve seen something similar to this progression in our own history.<br/>
There was a time when the United States was really “these united States,” a<br/>time when the dominant political reality was local and there were real differ-<br/>ences of culture and values between New York and Virginia. Despite these<br/>differences, in 1789 these states united to establish a relatively thin national<br/>government. This government was to be minimal and limited; it had a num-<br/>ber of narrow, strictly articulated purposes, beyond which it was not to go.<br/>
These limits made sense in the limited community that the United States<br/>
was. At the time there was very little that the states shared as a nation. They<br/>shared a history of defeating the strongest army in the world and a purpose of<br/>growing across an almost endless continent,16 but they did not share a social<br/>or political life. Life was local, exchange was relatively rare, and in such a<br/>world limited national government made sense.<br/>
Nevertheless, there were national questions to be articulated and resolved.<br/>
Slavery, for example, was a mark on our country as a whole, even though the<br/>practice was limited to a few states. There had been arguments at the founding<br/>about whether slavery should be left to local regulation. But the Constitution<br/>was founded on a compromise about that question. Congress was not permit-<br/>ted to address the question of the “importation” of slaves until 1808.17 After<br/>that, it could, and people, increasingly, said that it should. Slavery continued,<br/>however, to be a stain on the moral standing of our nation. Congress could<br/>eliminate it in the territories at least, and some argued that it should do so in<br/>the southern states as well.<br/>
Opponents to this call for Congress to cleanse our nation of slavery were<br/>
of two sorts. One type supported the institution of slavery and believed it<br/>was central to southern life. They are not my focus here. My focus is a second<br/>type—those who, with perfect integrity and candor, argued that slavery was a<br/>local issue, not a national issue; that the framers had understood it not to be<br/>a national issue; and that the national government should let it alone.<br/>

292<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
However true that claim might have been in 1791 or 1828, it became less<br/>
plausible over time. As the nation became socially and economically more<br/>integrated, the plausibility of saying “I am a Virginian first” declined, and the<br/>significance of being a citizen of the nation as a whole increased.18<br/>
This change came about not through some political decision but as a<br/>
result of a changing economic and social reality. Our sense of being members<br/>of a national community increased until, at a certain stage, it became impos-<br/>sible to deny our national citizenship. A war produced that recognition. The<br/>Fourteenth Amendment wrote it into the Constitution; economic and social<br/>intercourse made it completely real. And as this change took hold, the claim<br/>that issues like slavery were local became absurd.<br/>
The very same process is happening to us now, internationally, and cyber-<br/>
space is making an important contribution. It has been slowly gaining<br/>momentum, of course, since the end of World War II, but the Internet has<br/>wildly accelerated the pace. Ordinary citizens are connected internationally<br/>and can make international transactions as never before. The presence of a<br/>community that is beyond any individual state is increasingly undeniable.<br/>
As this international community develops in cyberspace, its citizens will<br/>
find it increasingly difficult to stand neutral in this international space. Just as<br/>a principled sort of citizen in 1791 might have said that slavery in Virginia was<br/>irrelevant to a citizen in Maine, so in 1991 the control of speech in Singapore<br/>may have been irrelevant to a citizen of the United States. But just as the<br/>claim about slavery’s local relevance became implausible in the course of the<br/>nineteenth century, the claim about speech on the Net will become equally<br/>implausible in the 21st century. Cyberspace is an international community;<br/>there are constitutional questions for it to answer; and we cannot simply<br/>stand back from this international space and say that these questions are local<br/>issues.<br/>
At least, we could not say that once we effectively invaded this interna-<br/>
tional space with the Internet of 1995. We put into the world an architecture<br/>that facilitated extraordinarily free speech and extraordinary privacy; that<br/>enabled secure communications through a protocol that permitted encryp-<br/>tion; and that encouraged free communications through a protocol that resis-<br/>ted censorship. That was the speech architecture that the Net gave the<br/>world—that we gave the world.<br/>
Now we are changing that architecture. We are enabling commerce in a<br/>
way we did not before; we are contemplating the regulation of encryption; we<br/>are facilitating identity and content control. We are remaking the values of the<br/>Net, and the question is: Can we commit ourselves to neutrality in this recon-<br/>struction of the architecture of the Net?<br/>

sovereignty<br/>
293<br/>
I don’t think that we can. Or should. Or will. We can no more stand neu-<br/>
tral on the question of whether the Net should enable centralized control of<br/>speech than Americans could stand neutral on the question of slavery in 1861.<br/>We should understand that we are part of a worldwide political battle; that we<br/>have views about what rights should be guaranteed to all humans, regardless<br/>of their nationality; and that we should be ready to press these views in this<br/>new political space opened up by the Net.<br/>
I am not arguing for world government. Indeed, the impossibility of such<br/>
an idea is the focus of much of the next chapter. My argument instead is that<br/>we must take responsibility for the politics we are building into this architec-<br/>ture, for this architecture is a sovereign governing the community that lives in<br/>that space. We must consider the politics of the architectures of the life there.<br/>
I have argued that we should understand the code in cyberspace to be its<br/>
own sort of regulatory regime, and that this code can sometimes be in com-<br/>petition with the law’s regulatory regime. For example, we saw how copyright<br/>law could be inconsistent with the regulatory regime of trusted systems. My<br/>argument is that we should understand these to be two regulatory regimes in<br/>competition with each other. We need a way to choose between them. We<br/>need a way to decide which should prevail.<br/>
As this system of regulation by code develops, it will contain its own<br/>
norms, which it will express in its structures or in the rules it imposes. If the<br/>predictions of law and economics are correct, these norms will no doubt be<br/>efficient, and they may well be just. But to the extent that justice does not track<br/>efficiency, they will be efficient and unjust. The question will then be: How do<br/>we react to this gap?<br/>
There is an important pattern in this competition between code and law.<br/>
Law, at least as it regulates international relations, is the product of extended<br/>negotiations. Countries must come to an agreement about how law will reg-<br/>ulate and about any norms that they will impose on private ordering. As their<br/>work relates to cyberspace in particular, this agreement is quite significant. It<br/>will require the nations of the world to come to a common understanding<br/>about this space and to develop a common strategy for dealing with its regu-<br/>lation.<br/>

CONFLICTS<br/>
Here are two stories about the power of sovereignty, one you’re likely to have<br/>heard of, and the other not.<br/>
1. Protecting the French<br/>
The French don’t like Nazis (and resist your French-bashing urge to add “any-<br/>more” to that sentence; remember, but for the French, we likely would not<br/>have a nation). French law doesn’t let the Nazis fight back. As in Germany, it<br/>is a crime in France to promote the Nazi party and sell Nazi paraphernalia.<br/>The French are vigilant that this virus of an ideology not revive itself in<br/>Europe.<br/>
French law is different from American law in this respect. The First<br/>
Amendment would block any viewpoint-based limitation on political prop-<br/>aganda. The state could no more block the sale of Nazi paraphernalia than it<br/>could block the sale of Republican buttons. Free speech means that the view-<br/>point of a political relic can’t determine whether the relic is sold.<br/>
Yahoo! is an American company. In 1999, Yahoo! opened a French<br/>
branch, and, at Yahoo! France, Yahoo! opened an auction site.1 Like eBay,<br/>this site permitted individuals to list items for auction. Like eBay, the site<br/>ran the auction and helped facilitate the ultimate sale of the items auc-<br/>tioned.<br/>
Very soon after the site opened, and contrary to French law, Nazi para-<br/>
phernalia began to appear on the Yahoo! auction sites available for sale in<br/>
294<br/>

295<br/>
France. Some in France were not happy. In 2000, a lawsuit was filed against<br/>Yahoo!, demanding Yahoo either remove the Nazi paraphernalia from its site<br/>or block access to the Nazi paraphernalia.2<br/>
This in turn made Yahoo! unhappy. This was the Internet, Yahoo! insisted.<br/>
It is a global medium. There was no way to block French citizens from the<br/>Yahoo! sites. And it would be absurd if the rules of one country became the<br/>rules of the world. There would be a race to the bottom (or top, depending<br/>upon your perspective) if every country could force every website in the world<br/>to comply with its own law. France should just accept that in the world of the<br/>Internet, the rule of France won’t be absolute. As the Ninth Circuit Court of<br/>Appeals summarized Yahoo!’s argument, “Yahoo! wants a decision providing<br/>broad First Amendment protection for speech . . . on the Internet that might<br/>violate the laws . . . of other countries.”3<br/>
French Judge Jean-Jacques Gomez didn’t agree with Yahoo! In an opinion<br/>
issued in May 2000, the judge required Yahoo! either to remove the Nazi para-<br/>phernalia or to block French citizens.4 In a second order issued in November,<br/>the French court directed Yahoo! to comply within three months, or pay<br/>100,000 French francs per day of the delay.5<br/>
The Internet was outraged. Thousands of websites criticized the French<br/>
Court’s decision, and hundreds of newspapers followed suit. France was<br/>destroying “free speech” on the Internet by forcing its rule on anyone who<br/>used the Internet anywhere. As the Cato Institute’s Adam Thierer com-<br/>mented,<br/>
Thankfully, Americans take free speech a bit more seriously than the Brits, the<br/>
French, the Germans and rest of the world. And, yes, America could become the<br/>
guardian of free speech worldwide by offering the protection of the First<br/>
Amendment over the Net to millions of people who have been denied the right<br/>
to speak freely in their own countries.6<br/>
2. Protecting Hollywood<br/>
In 2000, a serial entrepreneur, Bill Craig, launched a Toronto-based service for<br/>the World Wide Web called iCraveTV. iCraveTV was designed to stream ordi-<br/>nary television across the Internet. Under Canadian law, at least as interpreted<br/>at the time,7 iCraveTV believed it didn’t need permission to stream broadcast<br/>television across the Internet lines. Under Canadian law, so long as the broad-<br/>cast itself wasn’t changed, you could use any technology to extend the reach of<br/>the broadcast.8 So Craig bought his servers, fired up the streams, and with a<br/>

296<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
much-hyped launch, sat back to wait for the customers to come. And come<br/>they did, by the millions. Craig’s service was an instant success. It seemed lots<br/>more than Craig craved TV.<br/>
Not long after Craig’s launch, however, he began to discover that not<br/>
everyone loved Craig’s idea. In particular, U.S. copyright holders were not<br/>too keen on the free TV that Craig had created. While one was free in Canada<br/>to rebroadcast television across the Internet, one wasn’t in the United States.<br/>United States copyright law heavily regulates the right to rebroadcast, and<br/>Craig had not satisfied U.S rules.<br/>
iCraveTV did take some steps to keep U.S. residents out. But no one could<br/>
really have expected these steps would work. At first, iCraveTV simply warned<br/>people that only Canadians were to use the site. Later iCraveTV added an<br/>area-code block to its site—you needed to specify your area code to get in; if<br/>the area code was not Canadian, you couldn’t get in. But it’s not hard to find<br/>a Canadian area code (for example, the telephone number of iCraveTV itself<br/>prominently displayed on iCraveTV’s website.)<br/>
But Craig didn’t think it was his job to police the infringing behavior of<br/>
Americans. It didn’t violate the law for anyone to stream TV in Canada. Why<br/>did he need to worry about whether it violated the law in the U.S.?<br/>
A posse of American lawyers quickly convinced Craig that he needed to<br/>
worry. In a lawsuit filed in Pittsburgh, the National Football League (and a few<br/>other parties) charged iCraveTV with copyright infringement in the United<br/>States. Whether or not it was legal in Canada to stream TV across the Internet,<br/>it was not legal in the United States. Thus, to the extent Americans could get<br/>access to this Canadian site, they were violating American law. And to the<br/>extent this Canadian site made it possible for Americans to access this Cana-<br/>dian site, it was violating American law. The NFL thus demanded that the<br/>Pittsburgh court shut this Canadian server down.<br/>
The U.S. District Court Judge, Donald Ziegler, conducted an extensive<br/>
fact-finding proceeding. On February 8, 2000, the Court issued an injunction<br/>shutting iCraveTV down. The Court gave iCraveTV 90 days to demonstrate<br/>that it had the technology to block U.S. residents. iCraveTV promised that,<br/>using some of the IP technologies described in Chapter 4, it could block 98<br/>percent of American citizens. But 98 percent wasn’t good enough for the<br/>Court. If any American could access the iCraveTV site, iCraveTV was violat-<br/>ing U.S. law.<br/>
iCraveTV couldn’t promise 100 percent success. Unlike Judge Gomez’s<br/>
decision about France, however, there was no outrage on the Net following<br/>this decision. There weren’t thousands of websites criticizing it, or even a<br/>handful of editorials questioning it. Indeed, almost nobody noticed.<br/>

competition among sovereigns<br/>
297<br/>
Reciprocal Blindness<br/>
The Yahoo! France case and the iCraveTV case raise the same funda-<br/>
mental issue. In each, there is a behavior that is legal in one country (selling<br/>Nazi paraphernalia for the United States, streaming free TV across the Inter-<br/>net for Canada), and illegal in another country (selling Nazi paraphernalia in<br/>France; streaming free TV in the United States). In both cases, the judge in<br/>the country whose laws were being violated exercised his power to stop the<br/>violation (Judge Gomez ordering Yahoo! either to remove the Nazi material<br/>or to block it from France; Judge Ziegler ordering iCraveTV to either remove<br/>broadcast television from its site or block it from Americans). But in one<br/>case, this result was vilified as “censorship” while in the other, it was barely<br/>noticed.<br/>
This is reciprocal blindness. We see a fault in others that we can’t see in<br/>
ourselves. To an American, blocking the speech of Nazis is “censorship.” And<br/>it adds insult to injury to demand that such speech be censored in the United<br/>States—where it is legal—just because it is not legal in France.<br/>
But why isn’t it “censorship” to block free TV in Canada just because it is<br/>
illegal in the United States? In both cases, speech legal in one country is being<br/>blocked in that country by a court in a second. The United States blocks<br/>Canadians from getting free TV just because free TV is illegal in the United<br/>States. The French blocks Americans from getting Nazi paraphernalia on the<br/>Yahoo! auction site just because that paraphernalia is illegal in France.<br/>
Indeed, in one important respect, the iCraveTV case is worse than the<br/>
Yahoo! case. In the Yahoo! case, the Court considered evidence about whether<br/>Yahoo! could take technical measures to block French citizens.9 As Joel Reiden-<br/>berg emphasizes,10 its trigger for liability was the conclusion that there were<br/>reasonable technical means for blocking French citizens from the Nazi mate-<br/>rial. Those means weren’t perfect, but the Court estimated that over 90 percent<br/>of French users could be identified.11 But in the iCraveTV case, the technical<br/>means, though promised to be 98 percent effective, were deemed not enough.<br/>The restriction of the American court was thus greater than the restriction of<br/>French court.<br/>
Americans don’t have any monopoly on blindness. And I don’t pick this<br/>
case to pick on Americans. Instead, this brace of cases teaches a general lesson.<br/>There will be no nation that has no speech that it wishes to regulate on the<br/>Internet. Every nation will have something it wants to control. Those things,<br/>however, will be different, nation to nation. The French will want to regulate<br/>Nazi speech; the Americans will want to regulate porn; the Germans will want<br/>to regulate both; the Swedes will want to regulate neither.<br/>

298<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
This chapter is about these overlapping desires for control. How will the<br/>
Internet accommodate this mix? Whose rules will apply? Is there a way to<br/>avoid either anarchy or total regulation? Will the most restrictive regimes<br/>determine the freedom left for the rest of us?<br/>
In my view, we’ve seen enough to see how the story will unfold. I describe<br/>
that unfolding in the balance of this chapter. But first, we should be clear<br/>about the reason why this regulation of cyberspace will occur. We should all<br/>recognize the interest the government has here and just how strong, or weak,<br/>that interest is. And, more importantly, we should recognize how the architec-<br/>ture of the network has changed to make securing that interest possible. As<br/>Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu write,<br/>
Yahoo!’s arguments were premised on the 1990s vision of a borderless Internet.<br/>
Half a decade later, this vision is fast being replaced by the reality of an Internet<br/>
that is splitting apart and reflecting national borders. Far from flattening the<br/>
world, the Internet is in many ways conforming to local conditions.12<br/>
ON BEING “IN” CYBERSPACE<br/>
Cyberspace is a place.13 People live there. They experience all the sorts of<br/>things that they experience in real space there, and some experience more.<br/>They experience this, not as isolated individuals playing some high-tech com-<br/>puter game, but as part of groups, in communities, among strangers, and<br/>among people they come to know and sometimes like—or love.<br/>
While they are in that place, cyberspace, they are also here. They are at a<br/>
terminal screen, eating chips, ignoring the phone. They are downstairs on<br/>the computer, late at night, while their husbands are asleep. They are at work,<br/>at cyber cafes, and in computer labs. They live this life there, while here, and<br/>then at some point in the day they jack out and are only here. They rise from<br/>the machine in a bit of a daze, and turn around. They have returned.<br/>
So where are they when they are in cyberspace?<br/>We have this desire to pick: We want to say that they are either in cyber-<br/>
space or in real space. We have this desire because we want to know which<br/>space is responsible. Which space has jurisdiction over them? Which space<br/>rules?<br/>
The answer is both. Whenever anyone is in cyberspace, she is also here, in<br/>
real space. Whenever one is subject to the norms of a cyberspace community,<br/>one is also living within a community in real space. You are always in both<br/>places if you are there, and the norms of both places apply. The problem for<br/>

competition among sovereigns<br/>
299<br/>
law is to work out how the norms of the two communities are to apply given<br/>that the subject to whom they apply may be in both places at once.<br/>
Think again about Jake Baker. The problem with Jake was not that he<br/>
went to a different place where the norms were different. The problem was<br/>that he was simultaneously in a Michigan dorm room and on the Net. He was<br/>subject to the norm of civility in the dorm, and he was subject to the norm of<br/>indecency in cyberspace. He was subject, that is, to two sets of norms as he sat<br/>in that single chair.<br/>
So whose norms would apply? How would real-space governments deal<br/>
with the conflict between these two communities?<br/>
Some examples might help to set a context in which that question might<br/>
be answered. Ordinarily, when you go to Europe you do not bring the federal<br/>government with you. You do not carry along a set of rules for Americans<br/>while in Europe. In Germany you are generally subject to German law. The<br/>United States ordinarily has very little reason to worry about regulating your<br/>behavior there.<br/>
But sometimes the U.S. government does have a reason to regulate Amer-<br/>
ican citizens abroad. When it does, nothing in international law can stop it.14<br/>For example, there are jurisdictions where pedophilia is not adequately regu-<br/>lated, and for a time they became target tourist spots for pedophiles from<br/>around the world. The U.S. government passed a law in 1994 to forbid Amer-<br/>icans from engaging in child sex while outside the United States, even in juris-<br/>dictions where child sex is permitted.15<br/>
What justification could there have been for such a law? Obviously, the<br/>
sense of Congress was that if a person engages in such behavior in a foreign<br/>country, they are more likely to do it here as well. If they visit a community<br/>where the norms permit such behavior, they are more likely to carry those<br/>norms back to their life here. Thus, while the American government generally<br/>doesn’t much care what you do elsewhere, it does begin to care when what you<br/>do elsewhere has an effect on your life here.<br/>
Regulations like this are the exception, of course. But they are the excep-<br/>
tion because the practice of passing into alternative, or alien, communities in<br/>real space is also the exception. The frictions of real-space life make it less<br/>likely that the norms of an alien culture will bleed into our own; the distance<br/>between us and alien cultures is so great that very few can afford to have a life<br/>in both places.<br/>
But the Net changes this. As the Baker case suggests, and as any number of<br/>
other cases will press, with cyberspace these other communities are no longer<br/>elsewhere. They can be brought home, or more frighteningly, <i>into </i>the home.<br/>Real-space communities no longer have the buffer of friction to protect them.<br/>

300<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Another community can now capture the attention of their citizens without<br/>their citizens’ ever leaving their living room. People may be in both places at the<br/>same time. One affects the other. As Edward Castronova writes,“synthetic worlds<br/>are becoming important because events inside them can have effects outside<br/>them.”16 The question for government is how far to allow these effects to go.<br/>
Now this question has really three different parts—two old, and one new.<br/>
The old part is how a far a government will allow foreign influences to affect<br/>its culture and its people. Cultures at one time isolated are later invaded when<br/>the barriers to invasion fall. Think about the plea from Europeans to stop the<br/>invasion of American culture, which pours over satellite television into the liv-<br/>ing rooms of European citizens.17 Or even more extreme, the Middle East.<br/>These places have long fought to protect their culture from certain alien influ-<br/>ences, and that fight becomes much more difficult once the Internet becomes<br/>ubiquitous.<br/>
The second old part is the question of how, or whether, a government will<br/>
protect its citizens against foreign practices or rules that are inconsistent with<br/>its own. For example, the copyright law of France strongly protects the “moral<br/>rights” of French authors. If a French author enters into a contract with an<br/>American publisher, and that contract does not adequately protect the “moral<br/>rights” of the French citizen, how will the French respond?<br/>
But the third question—and the new part—is the issue raised by the abil-<br/>
ity for citizens to live in the alien culture while still at home. This is something<br/>more than merely watching foreign television. The alternatives offered by TV<br/>are alternatives of the imagination. The interactive life of cyberspace offers<br/>alternative ways of living (or at least some cyberspaces do).<br/>
My focus in this chapter is not on the first question, which many call cul-<br/>
tural imperialism. It is instead upon the conflicts that will be manifested by the<br/>second and third. It may well be true that there have always been conflicts<br/>between the rules of different governments. It may always have been that those<br/>conflicts have bled into particular local disputes. Cyberspace has exploded this<br/>third stage of the debate. What was once the exception will become the rule.<br/>Behavior was once governed ordinarily within one jurisdiction, or within two<br/>coordinating jurisdictions. Now it will systematically be governed within mul-<br/>tiple, noncoordinating jurisdictions. How can law handle this?<br/>
The integration of cyberspace will produce a profound increase in the<br/>
incidence of these conflicts. It will produce a kind of conflict that has never<br/>happened before: a conflict arising from individuals from different jurisdic-<br/>tions living together in one space while living in these different jurisdictions.<br/>
This question has produced a ferocious argument between two extremes.<br/>
At one end is the work of David Post and David Johnson. Johnson and Post<br/>

competition among sovereigns<br/>
301<br/>
argue that the multiplicity of jurisdictions in which your behavior is subject<br/>to regulation (since anything you do in cyberspace has an effect in every other<br/>context) should mean that much behavior is presumptively not subject to<br/>regulation anywhere. Anywhere, that is, save cyberspace.18 The inconsistency<br/>of any other solution, they argue, would be absurd. Rather than embracing the<br/>absurd, we should embrace something far more sensible: life in cyberspace, as<br/>Milan Kundera might put it, is life elsewhere.<br/>
At the other extreme is the work of scholars such as Jack Goldsmith and<br/>
Tim Wu, who claim there is nothing new here—at least new from the perspec-<br/>tive private international law.19 For many years the law has worked through<br/>these conflicts of authority. Cyberspace may increase the incidence of these<br/>conflicts, but it does not change their nature. Old structures may have to be<br/>molded to fit this new form, but the pattern of the old will suffice.<br/>
While both sides embrace partial truths, in my view both are mistaken. It<br/>
is true, as Johnson and Post argue, that there is something new here. But what<br/>is new is not a difference in kind, only a difference in degree. And it is true, as<br/>Goldsmith and Wu argues, that we have always had disputes of this form. But<br/>we have not had conflicts at this level. We have not had a time when we could<br/>say that people are actually living in two places at once, with no principle of<br/>supremacy between them. This is the challenge that we will face in the future.<br/>
This duality is a problem because the legal tools we have used to resolve<br/>
these questions before were not designed to deal with conflicts among citi-<br/>zens. They were designed to deal with conflicts among institutions, or rela-<br/>tively sophisticated actors. They are rules made for businesses interacting<br/>with businesses, or businesses interacting with governments. They were not<br/>designed for disputes between citizens.<br/>
Jessica Litman makes an analogous point in her work on copyright.20 For<br/>
much of the last century, Litman argues, copyright has worked fairly well as a<br/>compromise between publishers and authors. It is a law that has largely been<br/>applied to institutions. Individuals were essentially outside copyright’s<br/>purview since individuals didn’t really “publish.”<br/>
The Internet, of course, changes all this. Now everyone is a publisher.<br/>
And Litman argues (convincingly, in my view) that copyright’s rules do not<br/>necessarily work well when applied to individuals.21 The ideal rules for indi-<br/>viduals may not necessarily be the ideal rules for institutions. The rules of<br/>copyright need to be reformed to make them better suited to a world where<br/>individuals are publishers.<br/>
The same is true of conflicts between sovereigns. The rules for dealing<br/>
with these conflicts work well when the parties are repeat players—corpora-<br/>tions that must do business in two places, for example, or individuals who<br/>

302<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
constantly travel between two places. These people can take steps to conform<br/>their behavior to the limited range of contexts in which they live, and the<br/>existing rules help them to that end. But it does not follow (as it does not fol-<br/>low in the context of copyright) that the same mix of rules would work best<br/>in a world where anyone could be a multinational.<br/>
The solution to this change will not come from insisting either that every-<br/>
thing is the same or that everything is different. It will take more work than<br/>that. When a large number of citizens live in two different places, and when<br/>one of those places is not solely within the jurisdiction of a particular sover-<br/>eign, then what kinds of claims should one sovereign be able to make on oth-<br/>ers, and what kinds of claims can these sovereigns make on cyberspace?<br/>
This question is not yet answered. It is another latent ambiguity in our<br/>
Constitution’s past—but in this case there is no founding international con-<br/>stitutional moment. Even if there had been, it would not have answered this<br/>question. At the founding ordinary people were not routinely living in mul-<br/>tiple noncoordinating jurisdictions. This is something new.<br/>
POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS<br/>
That there will be conflicts in how governments want their citizens to behave<br/>is certain. What is not yet certain is how these conflicts will be resolved. In this<br/>section, I map three separate strategies. The first was the dream of the early<br/>Internet. The second is the reality that many nations increasingly see today.<br/>And the third is the world we will slowly become.<br/>
The No Law Rule<br/>
On February 8, 1996, John Perry Barlow, former lyricist for the Grateful Dead<br/>and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, published this decla-<br/>ration on EFF’s website:<br/>
Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come<br/>
from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of<br/>
the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sover-<br/>
eignty where we gather.<br/>
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address<br/>
you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks.<br/>
I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of<br/>
the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor<br/>
do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.<br/>

competition among sovereigns<br/>
303<br/>
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You<br/>
have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know<br/>
us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do<br/>
not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You<br/>
cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.<br/>
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you<br/>
create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics,<br/>
or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could<br/>
be obtained by any of your impositions.<br/>
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use<br/>
this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don’t<br/>
exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify<br/>
them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract.<br/>
This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours.<br/>
Our world is different.<br/>
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself,<br/>
arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world<br/>
that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.<br/>
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice<br/>
accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.<br/>
We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her<br/>
beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or<br/>
conformity.<br/>
Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and con-<br/>
text do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.<br/>
Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by<br/>
physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the<br/>
commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed<br/>
across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures<br/>
would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build<br/>
our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are<br/>
attempting to impose.<br/>
In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications<br/>
Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of<br/>
Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, de Tocqueville, and Brandeis. These<br/>
dreams must now be born anew in us.<br/>
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world<br/>
where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your<br/>
bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront<br/>
yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from<br/>

304<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation<br/>
of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings<br/>
beat.<br/>
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States,<br/>
you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the<br/>
frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but<br/>
they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.<br/>
Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate them-<br/>
selves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech<br/>
itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another indus-<br/>
trial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human<br/>
mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The<br/>
global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.<br/>
These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same posi-<br/>
tion as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to<br/>
reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual<br/>
selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule<br/>
over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can<br/>
arrest our thoughts.<br/>
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more<br/>
humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.22<br/>
Perhaps no single document better reflects an ideal that was dominant on<br/>
the network a decade ago. Whatever rule governed “our bodies,” no govern-<br/>ment could govern the “virtual selves” that would live in this space. Barlow<br/>declared these “virtual selves” “immune” from real space sovereigns. Real-<br/>space sovereigns would be lost if they tried to exercise control here.<br/>
Though Barlow issued his declaration at a meeting of world leaders at<br/>
Davos, apparently world governments didn’t hear what he said. That very<br/>day, the President signed the Communications Decency Act of 1996.23 And<br/>though the Supreme Court would eventually strike down this law, the<br/>Supreme Court was certainly not signaling the end of any regulation of “vir-<br/>tual selves.” A string of legislation from the United States Congress coincided<br/>with a string of regulation from around the world. And that trend has only<br/>increased. As one study measured it, the growth of legislative efforts to regu-<br/>late the Net was slow at first, but has taken off dramatically.24 These regula-<br/>tions were at first directed to “harness[ing] technology to serve what [were]<br/>perceived to be governmental goals unrelated to the net”; then second, “aimed<br/>directly at fostering the advancement of Net infrastructure”; and third,<br/>“directly concern[ed] control over information.”25<br/>

competition among sovereigns<br/>
305<br/>
The reasons Barlow’s ideals were not going to be realized might be obvi-<br/>
ous in retrospect, but they weren’t well recognized at the time. Laws are<br/>enacted as a result of political action; likewise they can be stopped only by<br/>political action. Ideas, or beautiful rhetoric, aren’t political action. When Con-<br/>gress confronts impassioned parents demanding it does something to protect<br/>their kids on the Net; or when it faces world-famous musicians angry about<br/>copyright infringement on the Net; or when it faces serious-seeming govern-<br/>ment officials talking about the dangers of crime on the Net, the rhetoric of<br/>even a Grateful Dead lyricist won’t cut it. On Barlow’s side, there had to be<br/>political action. But political action is just what the Net wasn’t ready for.<br/>
The One Law Rule<br/>
The opposite result of no law is a world where there is but one law. It is the<br/>world where one government (or conceivably, all governments working<br/>together, but that idea is too ridiculous to even contemplate so I won’t discuss<br/>it here) dominates the world by enforcing its law everywhere.<br/>
As Michael Geist convincingly argues, that’s indeed what is happening<br/>
now. “Governments,” Geist writes, are “unwilling to concede that national<br/>laws are limited to national borders, [and] are increasingly turning to explic-<br/>itly extra-territorial legislation.”26<br/>
Here again (unfortunately), the United States is a leader. The United<br/>
States has a view of proper network behavior. It has asserted the right to<br/>enforce that view extraterritorially, and it enforces its rule against citizens<br/>from around the world whether or not the U.S. rule conflicts with a local<br/>rule. The FTC, for example, is “vested with responsibility for enforcing [the<br/>Child Online Privacy Protection Act],” Geist writes, and “its rule-making<br/>guidance leaves no doubt that such sites are expected to comply with the<br/>statute in their privacy practices toward children.”27 So too does the Depart-<br/>ment of Justice maintain that the DMCA applies extraterritorially, because it<br/>refers to “imports” of technologies.28 And the USA Patriot Act includes pro-<br/>visions that “are expressly extra-territorial”—including, for example, an<br/>expansion of the list of “protected computers” to include “a computer located<br/>outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or for-<br/>eign commerce or communication of the United States.”29<br/>
Of course, Geist’s claim is not that the United States has tamed the<br/>
Internet. No one would assert that the United States has stopped crime on<br/>the network, or even behavior inconsistent with U.S. law. But the attitude<br/>and theory that animates U.S. prosecution has no conceptual limit. On the<br/>theory the United States advances, there is no behavior anywhere that at<br/>

306<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
least in principle the United States can’t reach. (Though there are many<br/>who believe international law restricts the United States more than it<br/>acknowledges.30)<br/>
It may be that this dominance by the United States will continue for ever.<br/>
But I doubt it. There is a growing desire among many governments around<br/>the world to check the power of the United States. In 2005, some of these<br/>government tried to wrest control of ICANN (Internet Corporation for<br/>Assigned Names and Numbers ) from U.S. influence. This resistance, as well<br/>as a healthy dose of sovereign self-respect, will increasingly push for a regime<br/>that better balances the interests of the whole world.<br/>
The Many Laws Rule (and the technology to make it possible)<br/>
So what would a more balanced regime look like?<br/>
Return to the conflict that began this chapter. On the one hand, France<br/>
doesn’t want its citizens buying Nazi paraphernalia, the United States doesn’t<br/>want its citizens watching “free” TV. On the other hand, France doesn’t have<br/>anything against “free” TV, and the United States doesn’t have the constitu-<br/>tional power to block its citizens from buying Nazi paraphernalia. It’s some<br/>way to give France what it wants (and doesn’t want), and to give the U.S.<br/>what it wants (and can’t want)?<br/>
This is not an issue limited to France and the United States. As Victor<br/>
Mayer-Schonberger and Teree Foster have written, about speech regulation:<br/>
National restrictions of freedom of speech on the [Internet] are commonplace not<br/>
only in the United States, but also around the globe. Individual nations, each<br/>
intent upon preserving what they perceive to be within the perimeters of their<br/>
national interests, seek to regulate certain forms of speech because of content that<br/>
is considered reprehensible or offensive to national well-being or civic virtue.31<br/>
Is there a general solution (in the government’s eyes at least) to this prob-<br/>
lem?<br/>
Well, imagine first that something like the Identity Layer that I described<br/>
in Chapter 4 finds its footing. And imagine that the ID layer means that indi-<br/>viduals are able to certify (easily and without necessarily revealing anything<br/>else) their citizenship. Thus, as you pass across the Web, attached to your<br/>presence is a cryptographic object that reveals at least which government<br/>claims you.<br/>
Second, imagine an international convention to populate a table with any<br/>
rules that a government wants to apply to its own citizens while those citizens<br/>

competition among sovereigns<br/>
307<br/>
are elsewhere in the world. So the French, for example, would want Nazi mate-<br/>rial blocked; the Americans would want porn blocked to anyone under 18, etc.<br/>The table would then be public and available to any server on the network.<br/>
Finally, imagine governments start requiring servers within their jurisdic-<br/>
tion to respect the rules expressed in the table. Thus, if you’re offering Nazi<br/>material, and a French citizen enters your site, you should block her, but if she<br/>is a U.S. citizen, you can serve her. Each state would thus be restricting the cit-<br/>izens of other states as those states wanted. But citizens from its nation would<br/>enjoy the freedoms that nation guarantees. This world would thus graft local<br/>rules onto life in cyberspace.<br/>
Consider a particular example to make the dynamic clearer: Internet<br/>
gambling.32 Minnesota has a strong state policy against gambling.33 Its legis-<br/>lature has banned its citizens from gambling, and its attorney general has vig-<br/>orously enforced this legislative judgment—both by shutting down gambling<br/>sites in the state and by threatening legal action against sites outside of the<br/>state if they let citizens from Minnesota gamble.<br/>
This threat, some will argue, can have no effect on gambling on the Inter-<br/>
net, nor on the gambling behavior of Minnesota citizens.34 The proof is the<br/>story of Boral: Imagine a gambling server located in Minnesota. When Min-<br/>nesota makes gambling illegal, that server can move outside of Minnesota.<br/>From the standpoint of citizens in Minnesota, the change has (almost) no<br/>effect. It is just as easy to access a server located in Minneapolis as one located<br/>in Chicago. So the gambling site can easily move and keep all its Minnesota<br/>customers.<br/>
Suppose that Minnesota then threatens to prosecute the owner of the<br/>
Chicago server. It is relatively easy for the attorney general to persuade the<br/>courts of Illinois to prosecute the illegal server in Chicago (assuming it could<br/>be shown that the behavior of the server was in fact illegal). So the server<br/>simply moves from Chicago to Cayman, making it one step more difficult for<br/>Minnesota to prosecute but still no more difficult for citizens of Minnesota to<br/>get access. No matter what Minnesota does, it seems the Net helps its citizens<br/>beat the government. The Net, oblivious to geography, makes it practically<br/>impossible for geographically limited governments to enforce their rules.<br/>
However, imagine the ID layer that I described above, in which everyone<br/>
can automatically (and easily) certify their citizenship. As you pass onto a<br/>site, the site checks your ID. Thus the gambling site could begin to condition<br/>access upon whether you hold the proper ID for that site—if you are from<br/>Minnesota and this is a gambling site the site does not let you pass. This<br/>process occurs invisibly, or machine to machine. All the user knows is that she<br/>has gotten in, or if she has not, then why.35<br/>

308<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
In this story, then, the interests of Minnesota are respected. Its citizens are<br/>
not allowed to gamble. But Minnesota’s desires do not determine the gam-<br/>bling practices of people from outside the state: Only citizens of Minnesota<br/>are disabled by this regulation.<br/>
This is regulation at the level of one state, for one problem. But why<br/>
would other states cooperate with Minnesota? Why would any other jurisdic-<br/>tion want to carry out Minnesota’s regulation?<br/>
The answer is that they wouldn’t if this were the only regulation at stake.<br/>
But it isn’t. Minnesota wants to protect its citizens from gambling, but New<br/>York may want to protect its citizens against the misuse of private data. The<br/>European Union may share New York’s objective; Utah may share Min-<br/>nesota’s.<br/>
Each state, in other words, has its own stake in controlling certain behav-<br/>
iors, and these behaviors differ. But the key is this: The same architecture that<br/>enables Minnesota to achieve its regulatory end can also help other states<br/>achieve their regulatory ends. And this can initiate a kind of quid pro quo<br/>between jurisdictions.<br/>
The pact would look like this: Each state would promise to enforce on<br/>
servers within its jurisdiction the regulations of other states for citizens from<br/>those other states, in exchange for having its own regulations enforced in<br/>other jurisdictions. New York would require that servers within New York<br/>keep Minnesotans away from New York gambling servers, in exchange for<br/>Minnesota keeping New York citizens away from privacy-exploiting servers.<br/>Utah would keep EU citizens away from privacy-exploiting servers, in<br/>exchange for Europe keeping Utah citizens away from European gambling<br/>sites.<br/>
This structure, in effect, is precisely the structure that is already in place<br/>
for regulating interstate gambling. According to federal law, interstate Internet<br/>gambling is not permitted unless the user is calling from a gambling-permis-<br/>sive state into another gambling-permissive state.36 If the user calls from a<br/>gambling-restrictive state or into a gambling-restrictive state, he or she has<br/>committed a federal offense.<br/>
The same structure could be used to support local regulation of Internet<br/>
behavior. With a simple way to verify citizenship, a simple way to verify that<br/>servers are discriminating on the basis of citizenship, and a federal commit-<br/>ment to support such local discrimination, we could imagine an architecture<br/>that enables local regulation of Internet behavior.<br/>
And if all this could occur within the United States, it could occur<br/>
between nations generally. There is the same interest internationally in enforc-<br/>ing local laws as there is nationally—maybe even more. And thus in this way,<br/>

competition among sovereigns<br/>
309<br/>
an ID-rich Internet would facilitate international zoning and enable this<br/>structure of international control.<br/>
Such a regime would return geographical zoning to the Net. It would re-<br/>
impose borders on a network built without those borders. If would give the<br/>regulators in Hungary and Thailand the power to do what they can’t do just<br/>now—control their citizens as they want. It would leave citizens of the<br/>United States or Sweden as free as their government has determined they<br/>should be.<br/>
To those who love the liberty of the original Net, this regime is a night-<br/>
mare. It removes the freedom the original architecture of the Internet created.<br/>It restores the power to control to a space designed to avoid control.<br/>
I too love the liberty of the original Net. But as I have become skeptical of<br/>
short-cuts to the policy I like—short-cuts, meaning devices that produce a<br/>particular result without effective democratic support—I’m hesitant to con-<br/>demn this regime. Of course, no democratic government should permit the<br/>will of a nondemocratic government to be reflected in a zoning table. We<br/>shouldn’t help totalitarian regimes repress their citizens. But within a family<br/>of democracies, such a regime might help promote democracy. If a restriction<br/>on liberty is resented by a people, let the people mobilize to remove it.<br/>
Of course, my view is that citizens of any democracy should have the<br/>
freedom to choose what speech they consume. But I would prefer they earn<br/>that freedom by demanding it through democratic means than that a techno-<br/>logical trick give it to them for free.<br/>
But whether or not you, or I, like this regime, my argument at this point<br/>
is predictive. This regime is a natural compromise between two results, neither<br/>of which governments accept—governments will neither accept a world<br/>where real space laws don’t affect cyberspace, nor a world where the rule of<br/>one government, or of a few large governments, controls the world. This<br/>regime gives each government the power to regulate its citizens; no govern-<br/>ment should have the right to do anything more.<br/>
This balance is already being struck privately on the Net—though there’s<br/>
significant resistance and unease about it. As I’ve already described, in January<br/>2005, Google announced that it was giving something to the Chinese govern-<br/>ment it has refused to give anyone else in the world—a version of the Google<br/>search engine that blocks content the Chinese government doesn’t want its<br/>citizens to see.37 Thus, if you search on “democracy” or “human rights” on<br/>Google.cn, you wouldn’t find what you’ll find if you search in the same way on<br/>Google.com. (Wikipedia now keeps a list of words blocked by search engines<br/>in China.38) Thus, Google would effectively remake the Internet for the Chi-<br/>nese according to the values the Chinese government pushes.<br/>

I understand the motive (profit). I certainly understand the justification<br/>
(it will speed China to a real democracy). But whether or not you believe this<br/>balance is right in the context of Communist China, it certainly has more<br/>justification when we’re describing agreements among democratic nations.<br/>What the Chinese do to its journalists is, in my view, wrong. If a Chinese<br/>publisher offered to publish this book in China only on the condition that I<br/>omitted this paragraph, I certainly wouldn’t. But I have a different view about<br/>rules imposed by France or Italy.<br/>
One important consequence of this architecture—indeed, perhaps reason<br/>
enough to oppose it—is that it will make regulation easier. And the easier it is<br/>to regulate, the more likely regulation is.<br/>
Yet this is the trade-off—between cost and the willingness to regulate—<br/>
we have seen again and again. Cost for the government is liberty for us. The<br/>higher the cost of a regulation, the less likely it will be enforced. Liberty<br/>depends on the regulation remaining expensive. Liberty comes with friction.<br/>
When it becomes easy or cheap to regulate, however, this contingent lib-<br/>
erty is at risk. We can expect more regulation. In these cases, if we want to pre-<br/>serve liberty, we will need to develop affirmative arguments for it. We will<br/>need these affirmative arguments to prevent identity-based regulation of the<br/>Net. As I explain in the balance of this book, there is both a surprisingly great<br/>desire for nations to embrace regimes that facilitate jurisdiction-specific reg-<br/>ulation and a significant reason why the costs of regulation are likely to fall.<br/>We should expect, then, that there will be more such regulation. Soon.<br/>
The effect, in short, would be to zone cyberspace based on the qualifica-<br/>
tions carried by individual users. It would enable a degree of control of cyber-<br/>space that few have ever imagined. Cyberspace would go from being an<br/>unregulable space to, depending on the depth of the certificates, the most<br/>regulable space imaginable.<br/>

The argument of Part I was that the unregulability of the original Internet will<br/>pass. Architectures will develop to make behavior there regulable again. Part<br/>II described one aspect of that regulability—technology. “Code” will be an<br/>increasingly important part of that regulation, directly enforcing the control<br/>the law typically achieves through threats. Part III then considered three con-<br/>texts in which changing technology would render ambiguous our commit-<br/>ments to fundamental values. This I called a latent ambiguity. How we protect<br/>IP, or privacy, or free speech will depend upon fundamental choices our<br/>framers didn’t make. Part IV then mapped this conflict to jurisdictions. Again,<br/>the lesson circles back to Part I: The tendency of government will push to an<br/>ever more regulable Net, this time to return the zones of geography to a bor-<br/>derless Internet.<br/>
Throughout these four parts, my central objective has been to force a<br/>
recognition that is obvious once remarked: that there are choices to be made<br/>about how this network evolves. These choices will affect fundamentally what<br/>values are built into the network.<br/>
The question for this part is whether we’re capable of making those<br/>
choices. My argument is that we’re not. We have so completely passed off<br/>questions of principle to the judicial branch, and so completely corrupted<br/>

312<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
our legislative process with the backhand of handouts, that we confront this<br/>moment of extraordinary importance incapable of making any useful deci-<br/>sions. We have been caught off-guard, drunk on the political indulgence of an<br/>era, and the most we may be able to do is stay on our feet until we have time<br/>to sober up.<br/>

THERE ARE CHOICES THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW CYBERSPACE IS. BUT, IN MY VIEW,<br/>we Americans are disabled from making those choices. We are disabled for<br/>three very different reasons. The first is tied to the limits we place on<br/>courts; the second to the limits we have realized in legislatures; and the<br/>third to the limits in our thinking about code. If choice must be made,<br/>these limits mean we will not be making that choice. We are at a time when<br/>the most significant decisions about what this space will be are being made,<br/>but we don’t have the institutions, or practice, to evaluate or readily alter<br/>them.<br/>
In this chapter, I describe these problems, and in Chapter 17, I sketch<br/>
three solutions to them. Neither description will be complete, but both<br/>should be suggestive. The problems that cyberspace reveals are not problems<br/>with cyberspace. They are real-space problems that cyberspace shows us we<br/>must now resolve—or maybe reconsider.<br/>
PROBLEMS WITH COURTS<br/>
There are two types of constitutions, one we could call codifying, and the<br/>other transformative. A codifying constitution tries to preserve something<br/>essential about the constitutional or legal culture in which it is enacted—to<br/>protect that cultural attribute against changes in the future. A transformative<br/>constitution (or amendment) does the opposite: It tries to change something<br/>essential in the constitutional or legal culture in which it is enacted—to make<br/>life different in the future, to remake some part of the culture. The symbol of<br/>the codifying regime is Ulysses tied to the mast; the symbol of the transfor-<br/>mative is revolutionary France.<br/>
313<br/>

314<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Our Constitution has both regimes within it. The Constitution of<br/>
1789—before the first ten amendments—was a transformative constitu-<br/>tion. It “called into life” a new form of government and gave birth to a<br/>nation.1 The Constitution of 1791—the Bill of Rights—was a codifying<br/>constitution. Against the background of the new constitution, it sought to<br/>entrench certain values against future change.2 The Civil War amendments<br/>were transformative again. They aimed to remake part of what the Ameri-<br/>can social and legal culture had become—to rip out from the American<br/>soul a tradition of inequality and replace it with a tradition and practice of<br/>equality.3<br/>
Of these two regimes, the transformative is clearly the more difficult to<br/>
realize. A codifying regime at least has inertia on its side; a transformative<br/>regime must fight. The codifying regime has a moment of self-affirmation;<br/>the transformative regime is haunted with self-doubt and vulnerable to being<br/>undermined by targeted opposition. Constitutional moments die, and when<br/>they do, the institutions charged with enforcing their commands, such as<br/>courts, face increasing political resistance. Flashes of enlightenment notwith-<br/>standing, the people retain or go back to their old ways, and courts find it hard<br/>to resist.<br/>
Our own constitutional history reveals just this pattern. The extraordi-<br/>
nary moment after the Civil War—when three amendments committed to<br/>civil equality were carved into our Constitution’s soul—had passed by 1875.<br/>The nation gave up the struggle for equality and turned to the excitement of<br/>the Industrial Revolution. Laws enforcing segregation were upheld;4 the right<br/>of African Americans to vote was denied;5 laws enforcing what was later seen<br/>to be a new kind of slavery were allowed.6 Only after one hundred years of<br/>continued inequality did the Supreme Court again take up the cause of the<br/>Civil War amendments. It would not be until <i>Brown v. Board of Education, </i>in<br/>1954, that the Court again recognized the transformative idea of the Civil<br/>War amendments.7<br/>
One could criticize the Court for this century of weakness. I think it is<br/>
more important to understand its source. Courts operate within a political<br/>context. They are the weakest branch of resistance within that political con-<br/>text. For a time, they may be able to insist on a principle greater than the<br/>moment, but that time will pass. If the world does not recognize the wrong-<br/>ness of its racist ways, even a strong statement of principle enacted within our<br/>Constitution’s text permits a court only so much freedom to resist. Courts are<br/>subject to the constraints of what “everyone” with a voice and the resources to<br/>make it heard believes is right, even if what “everyone” believes is inconsistent<br/>with basic constitutional texts.<br/>

the problems we face<br/>
315<br/>
Life is easier with a codifying constitution, because there is a tradition that<br/>
the text is just meant to entrench. If this tradition is long-standing, then there<br/>is hope that it will remain solid as well.<br/>
But even a codifying constitution faces difficulties. Codification notwith-<br/>
standing, if the passions of a nation become strong enough, there is often<br/>little that courts are willing to do. The clarity of the First Amendment’s pro-<br/>tection of freedom of speech notwithstanding, when the speech was that of<br/>communists and anarchists, the government was allowed the power to pun-<br/>ish.8 The presumption of innocence and equality notwithstanding, when<br/>Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, the government was allowed to shuttle every<br/>West Coast American of Japanese descent into concentration camps.9<br/>
These are the realities of courts in a democratic system. We lawyers like to<br/>
romanticize the courts, to imagine them as above influence. But they have<br/>never been so, completely or forever. They are subject to a political constraint<br/>that matters. They are an institution within a democracy, and no institution<br/>within a democracy can be the enemy of the people for long.<br/>
It is against this background that we should think about the problems<br/>
raised in Parts 3 and 4. In each case, my argument was that we will need to<br/>choose the values we want cyberspace to embrace. These questions are not<br/>addressed by any clear constitutional text or tradition. In the main, they are<br/>questions affecting the codifying part of our tradition, but they are also cases<br/>of latent ambiguity. There is no “answer” to them in the sense of a judgment<br/>that seems to have been made and that a court can simply report. An answer<br/>must be fixed upon, not found; made, not discovered; chosen, not reported.<br/>
This creates difficulties for an American court. We live in the shadow of<br/>
the Supreme Court of Chief Justice Earl Warren. Many people think (but I am<br/>not one of this crowd) that his was a wildly activist court, that it “made up”<br/>constitutional law and imposed its own “personal values” onto the political<br/>and legal system. Many viewed the Rehnquist Court as providing a balance to<br/>this activism of old.<br/>
I think this view is wrong. The Warren Court was not “activist” in any sense<br/>
inconsistent with a principle of interpretive fidelity, and the Rehnquist Court<br/>was no less activist in that sense than the Warren Court. The question, however,<br/>is not what was true; the question is what people believe. What we believe is that<br/>the past was marked by activism, and that this activism was wrong.<br/>
At least wrong for a court. The opponents of the Warren Court are not<br/>
just conservatives. Some are liberals who believe that the Court was not acting<br/>judicially.10 These opponents believe that the Court was making, not finding,<br/>constitutional law—that it was guided by nothing more than whether it could<br/>muster a majority.<br/>

316<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
Any court risks seeming like a “Warren Court” when it makes judgments<br/>
that don’t seem to flow plainly or obviously from a legal text. Any court is vul-<br/>nerable when its judgments seem political. Against the background of history,<br/>our Supreme Court is particularly vulnerable to this view, and the Court will<br/>feel the reaction when its actions seem political.<br/>
My point is not that the Court fears retaliation; our Court is secure within<br/>
our constitutional regime.11 The Court feels the reaction to its seemingly<br/>political decisions because of its own image of its proper role. In its view, its<br/>role is not to be “political”; its conception is that it is to be a faithful agent,<br/>simply preserving founding commitments until they have changed.12<br/>
But when—as in the cases of latent ambiguity—there are no founding<br/>
commitments to preserve, any attempt at translation will seem to be some-<br/>thing more. And whenever it seems as if the Court is doing more than simply<br/>preserving founding commitments, the perception is created that the Court is<br/>simply acting to ratify its own views of a proper constitutional regime rather<br/>than enforcing judgments that have been constitutionalized by others.13 In a<br/>word, it seems to be acting “politically.”<br/>
But what does “political” mean here? It does not mean simply that the<br/>
Court is making value or policy choices. The claim is not that values are<br/>improper reasons for a court to decide a case. To the contrary: Value choices<br/>or policy choices, properly ratified by the political process, are appropriate for<br/>judicial enforcement. The problem with the choices in cases of latent ambigu-<br/>ity is that they do not seem to have been properly ratified by the political<br/>process. They reflect values, but the values do not seem to be taken from the<br/>Constitution.<br/>
“Political” thus refers to judgments not clearly ratified and presently con-<br/>
tested.14 When the very foundations of a judgment are seen to be fundamen-<br/>tally contested, and when there is no reason to believe that the Constitution<br/>takes a position on this contest, then enforcing a particular outcome of trans-<br/>lation will appear, in that context, political.15<br/>
Cyberspace will press this problem intensely. When a framing value can<br/>
be translated with some clarity or certainty, the Court can act in a way that<br/>resists present majorities in the name of founding commitments. But when<br/>ambiguities are latent and a choice really seems to be a choice, translation will<br/>not suffice. My claim is that the Court will not be the locus for that choice.<br/>
This might seem overly pessimistic, especially when we consider the suc-<br/>
cess in striking down the Communications Decency Act.16 But that case itself<br/>reveals the instability that I fear will soon resolve itself into passivity.<br/>
Throughout both lower court opinions, the courts spoke as if they were<br/>
“finding” facts about the nature of cyberspace. The “findings” determined<br/>

the problems we face<br/>
317<br/>
the constitutional result, and both courts reported their findings with a con-<br/>fidence that made them seem set in stone.<br/>
These findings, for the most part, were exceptionally good descriptions of<br/>
where cyberspace was in 1996. But they did not tell us anything about where<br/>cyberspace is going or what it could be. The courts spoke as if they were<br/>telling us about the nature of cyberspace. But as we’ve seen, cyberspace has no<br/>intrinsic nature. It is as it is designed. By striking down Congress’s efforts to<br/>zone cyberspace, the courts were not telling us what cyberspace is but what it<br/>should be. They were making, not finding, the nature of cyberspace; their<br/>decisions are in part responsible for what cyberspace will become.<br/>
At first it will not seem this way. When we confront something new, it is<br/>
hard to know what is natural or given about it, and what part can be changed.<br/>But over time courts will see that there is little in cyberspace that is “natural.”<br/>Limits on the architecture of cyberspace that they have reported as findings in<br/>one opinion will be seen to have been “design choices” later on. What was<br/>“impossible” will later become possible, and as these shifts in the possible<br/>occur, courts will more and more feel that they cannot really say what cyber-<br/>space is. They will see that their findings affect what they find. They will see<br/>that they are in part responsible for what cyberspace has become.<br/>
This is Heisenberg applied to constitutional law. And as courts notice it,<br/>
as they have in other areas, they will increasingly defer to the political<br/>branches: If these judgments are policy, they will be left to policy makers, not<br/>judges.17<br/>
One can hardly blame judges for this. Indeed, in some cases their defer-<br/>
ence should be encouraged.18 But we should not underestimate its conse-<br/>quences. In the future legislatures will act relatively unconstrained by courts;<br/>the values that we might call constitutional—whether enacted into our Con-<br/>stitution or not—will constrain these legislatures only if they choose to take<br/>them into account.<br/>
Before we turn to what we might expect from legislatures, consider one<br/>
other problem with courts—specifically, the problem confronting our consti-<br/>tutional tradition as the Constitution moves into the context of cyberspace.<br/>This is the problem of “state action.”<br/>
Architectures constitute cyberspace; these architectures are varied; they<br/>
variously embed political values; some of these values have constitutional<br/>import. Yet for the most part—and fortunately—these architectures are pri-<br/>vate. They are constructed by universities or corporations and implemented<br/>on wires no longer funded by the Defense Department. They are private and<br/>therefore traditionally outside the scope of constitutional review. The consti-<br/>tutional values of privacy, access, rights of anonymity, and equality need not<br/>

318<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
trouble this new world, since this world is “private” and the Constitution is<br/>concerned only with “state action.”<br/>
Why this should be is not clear to me. If code functions as law, then we are<br/>
creating the most significant new jurisdiction since the Louisiana Purchase.<br/>Yet we are building it just outside the Constitution’s review. Indeed, we are<br/>building it just so that the Constitution will not govern—as if we want to be<br/>free of the constraints of value embedded by that tradition.<br/>
So far in this book, I have not relied very much on this private/public dis-<br/>
tinction. You might say I have ignored it.19 But I have ignored it not because<br/>it makes no sense, but because I don’t know how it could be carried over to<br/>the regulation of cyberspace. The concept of state action itself presents a<br/>latent ambiguity, and I don’t think we have a clear idea of how to resolve it.<br/>
That latent ambiguity is this: The Constitution was drawn at a time when<br/>
basic architectures were set. The framers found the laws of nature, the laws of<br/>economics, the “natural law” of man; they were not made by government or<br/>man.<br/>
These architectures constrained, of course, and their constraint was a<br/>
“regulation.” But the degree to which they could be used as tools of self-con-<br/>scious control was limited. Town planning was not limited,20 and beyond lay-<br/>ing out a space, there was little these founders could do about the rules that<br/>would govern the built environment of this space.<br/>
Cyberspace, however, has different architectures, whose regulatory power<br/>
are not so limited. An extraordinary amount of control can be built into the<br/>environment that people know there. What data can be collected, what<br/>anonymity is possible, what access is granted, what speech will be heard—all<br/>these are choices, not “facts.” All these are designed, not found.<br/>
Our context, therefore, is very different. That the scope of constitutional<br/>
review was limited in the first context does not compel it to be similarly lim-<br/>ited in the second. It could be, but we cannot know that merely from its being<br/>so limited in a very different context.<br/>
We have no answer from the framers, then, about the scope of state<br/>
action. We must decide on our own what makes better sense of our constitu-<br/>tional tradition. Is it more faithful to our tradition to allow these structures of<br/>control, the functional equivalent of law, to develop outside the scope of con-<br/>stitutional review? Or should we extend constitutional review to the structures<br/>of private regulation, to preserve those fundamental values within our tradi-<br/>tion?<br/>
These are hard questions, though it is useful to note that they are not as<br/>
hard to ask in other constitutional regimes. The German tradition, for exam-<br/>ple, would have less trouble with the idea that private structures of power<br/>

the problems we face<br/>
319<br/>
must ultimately be checked against fundamental constitutional values.21 The<br/>German tradition, of course, is not our own. But the fact that they have sus-<br/>tained this view suggests that we can make space for the constraint of the<br/>Constitution without turning everything into a constitutional dispute. Rea-<br/>soned decision is possible without turning every private contract into a federal<br/>case.<br/>
Nevertheless, it will take a revolution in American constitutional law for<br/>
the Court, self-consciously at least, to move beyond the limits of state action.<br/>Scholars have sketched how it could without radically remaking American<br/>law, but others have argued it could not without radically remaking the Amer-<br/>ican Constitution.22<br/>
But my reason for ignoring the state action doctrine is not so much to<br/>
radically remake law as it is to give us a clearer sense of how we should make<br/>the law in this new space in the first place. As Paul Berman puts it, the reason<br/>to ignore the state action doctrine for now is that:<br/>
. . . however such questions get resolved, at least we will have been forced to<br/>
grapple with the substantive constitutional question and to articulate the com-<br/>
peting values at stake. The state action doctrine, in contrast, takes such debates<br/>
off the table altogether by asserting that the activity at issue is private and there-<br/>
fore not a fit subject for the constitutional discourse. If one believes that such<br/>
discourse, in and of itself, has cultural value, then application of the state action<br/>
doctrine comes with a significant cost.23<br/>
Again, it remains likely that we will continue to suffer this cost.<br/>It is in these two ways then that courts are stuck. They cannot be as cre-<br/>
ative, and the scope of their constitutional review has been narrowed (artifi-<br/>cially, I believe) to exclude the most important aspect of cyberspace’s<br/>law—code. If there are decisions about where we should go, and choices about<br/>the values this space will include, then these are choices we can’t expect our<br/>courts to make.<br/>
PROBLEMS WITH LEGISLATORS<br/>
At a conference in former Soviet Georgia, sponsored by some Western agency<br/>of democracy, an Irish lawyer was trying to explain to the Georgians what was<br/>so great about a system of “judicial review” (the system by which courts can<br/>strike down the acts of a parliament). “Judicial review,” he enthused, “is won-<br/>derful. Whenever the court strikes down an act of parliament, the people nat-<br/>urally align themselves with the court, against the parliament. The parliament,<br/>

320<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
people believe, is just political; the supreme court, they think, is principled.”<br/>A Georgian friend, puppy-democrat that he was, asked, “So why is it that in a<br/>democracy the people are loyal to a nondemocratic institution and repulsed<br/>by the democratic institution in the system?” “You just don’t understand<br/>democracy,” said the lawyer.<br/>
When we think about the question of governing cyberspace—when we<br/>
think about the questions of choice I’ve sketched, especially those raised in<br/>Part III—we are likely to get a sinking feeling. It seems impossibly difficult,<br/>this idea of governing cyberspace. Who is cyberspace? Where would it vote?<br/>The very idea seems abhorrent to cyberspace itself.<br/>
But the problem here is not with governance in cyberspace. Our problem<br/>
is with governance itself. There is no special set of dilemmas that cyberspace<br/>will present; there are only the familiar dilemmas of modern governance, but<br/>in a new place. Some things are different; the target of governance is different;<br/>the scope of international concerns is different. But the difficulty with gover-<br/>nance will not come from this different target; the difficulty comes from our<br/>problem with governance.<br/>
Throughout this book, I’ve worked to identify the choices that cyber-<br/>
space will present. I’ve argued that its very architecture is up for grabs and<br/>that, depending on who grabs it, there are several different ways it could<br/>turn out. Clearly some of these choices are collective—about how we collec-<br/>tively will live in this space. One would have thought that collective choices<br/>were problems of governance, but very few of us would want government to<br/>make these choices. Government seems the solution to no problem we have,<br/>and we should understand why this is. We should understand the Irish<br/>lawyer in all of us.<br/>
Our skepticism is not a point about principle. Most of us are not libertar-<br/>
ians. We may be antigovernment, but for the most part we believe that there<br/>are collective values that ought to regulate private action. (“Collective” just in<br/>the sense that all individuals acting alone will produce less of that value than<br/>if that individual action could be coordinated.) We are also committed to the<br/>idea that collective values should regulate the emerging technical world. Our<br/>problem is that we do not know how it should be regulated, or by whom. And<br/>we fear that the values that will be embraced are not the correct ones.<br/>
Like the Irish lawyer, we are weary of governments. We are profoundly<br/>
skeptical about the product of democratic politics. We believe, rightly or not,<br/>that these processes have been captured by special interests more concerned<br/>with individual than collective values. Although we believe that there is a role<br/>for collective judgments, we are repulsed by the idea of placing the design of<br/>something as important as the Internet into the hands of governments.<br/>

the problems we face<br/>
321<br/>
The examples here are many, and the pattern is arresting. The single<br/>
unifying message in the government’s own description of its role in cyber-<br/>space is that it should simply get out of the way. In the area of Internet com-<br/>merce, the government says, commerce should take care of itself. (Of course,<br/>at the same time, the government is passing all sorts of laws to increase the<br/>protections for intellectual property.) The government is also seemingly<br/>enthusiastic about regulating “indecent” content regardless of the thriving<br/>commerce in it.<br/>
A perfect example of this point is the government’s hand-off of control of<br/>
the management of the domain name system. For some time the government<br/>had been thinking about how best to continue the governance or control of<br/>the domain name system.24 It had originally farmed the work out under<br/>National Science Foundation contracts, first to a California nonprofit organ-<br/>ized by the late Jon Postel, and then to a private for-profit corporation, Net-<br/>work Solutions.<br/>
The contracts were due to lapse in 1998, however, and for a year the gov-<br/>
ernment thought in earnest about what it should do. In June 1998 it released<br/>a White Paper calling for the establishment of a nonprofit corporation<br/>devoted to the collective interest of the Internet as a whole and charged with<br/>deciding the policy questions relating to governing the domain name system.<br/>Policy-making power was to be taken away from government and placed with<br/>an organization outside its control. In 1998, that policy was effected through<br/>the creation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers<br/>(ICANN), which, according to its webpage, is<br/>
dedicated to preserving the operational stability of the Internet; to promoting<br/>
competition; to achieving broad representation of global Internet communities;<br/>
and to developing policy appropriate to its mission through bottom-up, consen-<br/>
sus-based processes. ICANN, a public benefit, non-profit entity, is the interna-<br/>
tional organization responsible for the management and oversight of the<br/>
coordination of the Internet’s domain name system and its unique identifiers.25<br/>
Think about the kinds of questions my Georgian friend might ask about<br/>
this move. A “nonprofit corporation devoted to the collective interest”? Isn’t<br/>that just what government is supposed to be? A board composed of represen-<br/>tative stakeholders? Isn’t that what a Congress is? Indeed, my Georgian friend<br/>might observe that this corporate structure differs from government in only<br/>one salient way—there is no ongoing requirement of elections.<br/>
This is policy making vested in what is in effect an independent agency,<br/>
but one wholly outside the democratic process. And what does this say about<br/>

322<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
us? What does it mean when our natural instinct is to put policy-making<br/>power in bodies outside the democratic process?<br/>
First, it reflects the pathetic resignation that most of us feel about the<br/>
products of ordinary government. We have lost faith in the idea that the prod-<br/>uct of representative government might be something more than mere inter-<br/>est—that, to steal the opening line from Justice Marshall’s last Supreme Court<br/>opinion, power, not reason, is now the currency of deliberative democracy.26<br/>We have lost the idea that ordinary government might work, and so deep is<br/>this despair that not even government thinks the government should have a<br/>role in governing cyberspace.<br/>
I understand this resignation, but it is something we must overcome. We<br/>
must isolate the cause and separate it from the effect. If we hate government,<br/>it is not because the idea of collective values is anathema. If we hate govern-<br/>ment, it is because we have grown tired of our own government. We have<br/>grown weary of its betrayals, of its games, of the interests that control it. But<br/>we must find a way to get over that weariness.<br/>
One central cause of the dysfunction of government is the corruption<br/>
suggested by the way government is elected. I don’t mean “corruption” in the<br/>traditional sense that saps the energy from so many developing nations. I<br/>don’t believe congressmen are on the take (California’s Randy Cunningham is<br/>an exception, of course27); I don’t believe their motives are impure. They are<br/>trying to do the best they can in the world they inhabit. But it is that world<br/>that is the problem.<br/>
For with that world, money controls attention. To become a member of<br/>
the House of Representatives, you have to run. In 2004, if you ran in an open<br/>district, then you spent on average $1,086,437. If you won, you spent<br/>$1,442,216. If you ran against an incumbent in 2004, then there’s a 97.5 per-<br/>cent chance you didn’t win. (Only eight challengers won.) In the Senate, only<br/>one challenger defeated a sitting senator in 2004. Incumbency means life<br/>tenure in the United States. The average term for a member of Congress rivals<br/>the average term for a Supreme Court Justice.28<br/>
To raise this money, members of Congress must spend their time making<br/>
those with money happy. They do this by listening to their problems, and<br/>sometimes, pushing legislation that will solve those problems. That sounds<br/>harmless enough, until you begin to realize just how much time they spend<br/>doing this fundraising. Former Senator Hollings estimated that one-third of<br/>a senator’s time is spent fundraising.29 That’s probably a significant underes-<br/>timate.30<br/>
Now just think about how absurd these priorities are. Congressmen work<br/>
for us. If an employee of a restaurant spent 33 percent of her time arranging<br/>

the problems we face<br/>
323<br/>
to get to work, she’d be fired. But that’s essentially what happens in Washing-<br/>ton. The most significant chunk of time for members of Congress is time<br/>spent to raise money to remain members of Congress. Is this really what we<br/>pay them for?<br/>
The problem here is not so much that members of Congress aren’t doing<br/>
their work. The problem is the way their work gets queered by this need to<br/>raise money. The easiest targets for fundraising are the clients of the lobbyists,<br/>and the lobbyists have lots of ideas about how to bend the law to benefit their<br/>clients.<br/>
And so Congress bends, and the law gets changed to benefit the most<br/>
powerful in the economy. This is not capitalism as much as lobby-ism. Our<br/>economy is defined by a combination of laws benefiting some and power<br/>benefiting some.<br/>
To crack through lobbyism, you need a way to get the attention of mem-<br/>
bers of Congress. But until the system is changed, the only way to get their<br/>attention is money. This is the cycle. Its results for democracy are vicious.<br/>Our Congress sees only what a small set want them to see. And what they see<br/>often has no obvious connection to the truth.<br/>
If there is a decision to be made about how cyberspace will grow, then<br/>
that decision will be made. The only question is by whom. We can stand by<br/>and do nothing as these choices are made—by others, by those who will not<br/>simply stand by. Or we can try to imagine a world where choice can again be<br/>made collectively and responsibly.<br/>
PROBLEMS WITH CODE<br/>
At a Harvard workshop around the time the first edition of this book was<br/>published, Jean Camp, a Harvard computer scientist who taught in the<br/>Kennedy School of Government, said that I had missed the point. The prob-<br/>lem, she said, is not that “code is law” or that “code regulates.” The problem is<br/>that “we haven’t had a conversation about how code regulates.” And then to<br/>the rest of the audience, she said, “Did all of you like the debate we had about<br/>whether Microsoft Word documents would carry in them a unique identify-<br/>ing number? Was that a satisfying debate?”<br/>
Her irony carried with it an important insight, and an interesting mistake.<br/>
Of course, for the computer scientist code is law. And if code is law, then<br/>obviously the question we should ask is: Who are the lawmakers? Who writes<br/>this law that regulates us? What role do we have in defining this regulation?<br/>What right do we have to know of the regulation? And how might we inter-<br/>vene to check it?<br/>

324<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
All that is perfectly obvious for someone who thinks and breathes the<br/>
regulations of code. But to a lawyer, both Camp and I, throughout this book,<br/>have made a very basic mistake. Code is not law, any more than the design of<br/>an airplane is law. Code does not regulate, any more than buildings regulate.<br/>Code is not public, any more than a television is public. Being able to debate<br/>and decide is an opportunity we require of public regulation, not of private<br/>action.<br/>
Camp’s mistake is a good one. It is a mistake more of us should make<br/>
more of the time. Because while of course code is private, and of course dif-<br/>ferent from the U.S. Code, its differences don’t mean there are not similarities<br/>as well. “East Coast Code”—law—regulates by enabling and limiting the<br/>options that individuals have, to the end of persuading them to behave in a<br/>certain way. “West Coast Code” does the same. East Coast Code does this by<br/>increasing the cost to those who would deviate from the rules required by the<br/>code. West Coast Code does the same. And while we might argue that East<br/>Coast Code is more prevalent—that it regulates and controls a far larger part<br/>of our lives—that is a difference in degree, not kind. It’s a reason to be bal-<br/>anced in our concern, not to be unconcerned.<br/>
Of course, there are differences between law and code. I don’t think that<br/>
everything is necessarily public, or that the Constitution should regulate every<br/>aspect of private life. I don’t think it is a constitutional issue when I turn off<br/>Rush Limbaugh. But to say that there should be a difference is not to say that<br/>the difference should be as absolute as present constitutional thinking makes<br/>it. When we lawyers tell the Jean Camps of the world that they are simply<br/>making a “mistake” when they bring the values of public law to code, it is<br/>rather we who are making the mistake. Whether code should be tested with<br/>these constraints of public value is a question, not a conclusion. It needs to be<br/>decided by argument, not definition.<br/>
This won’t be easy, of course. Code is technical; courts aren’t well posi-<br/>
tioned to evaluate such technicality. But even so, the failure is not even to try.<br/>The formalism in American law, which puts beyond review these structures of<br/>control, is a third pathology that inhibits choice. Courts are disabled, legisla-<br/>tures pathetic, and code untouchable. That is our present condition. It is a<br/>combination that is deadly for action—a mix that guarantees that little good<br/>gets done.<br/>

r e s p o n s e s<br/>
WE NEED A PLAN. I’VE TOLD A DARK STORY ABOUT THE CHOICES THAT A CHANGING<br/>cyberspace is presenting, and about our inability to respond to these choices.<br/>I’ve linked this inability to three features of our present legal and political<br/>culture. In this short chapter, I consider three responses. These responses are<br/>nothing more than sketches, but they should be enough to suggest the nature<br/>of the changes we need to make.<br/>
RESPONSES OF A JUDICIARY<br/>
I’ve said that we should understand judicial hesitancy as grounded in pru-<br/>dence. When so much seems possible, and when a rule is not clearly set, it is<br/>hard for a court to look like a court as it decides what policies seem best.1<br/>
Although I agree with this ideal of prudence in general, we need to move<br/>
its counsel along—to place it in context and limit its reach. We should isolate<br/>the source of the judge’s difficulty. Sometimes a certain hesitation before<br/>resolving the questions of the Constitution in cyberspace finally, or firmly, or<br/>with any pretense to permanence, is entirely appropriate. But in other cases,<br/>judges—especially lower court judges—should be stronger, because there are<br/>many of them and because many are extraordinarily talented and creative.<br/>Their voices would teach us something here, even if their rulings were tempo-<br/>rary or limited in scope.<br/>
In cases of simple translation (where there are no latent ambiguities and<br/>
our tradition seems to speak clearly), judges should firmly advance arguments<br/>that seek to preserve original values of liberty in a new context. In these cases<br/>there is an important space for activism. Judges should identify our values and<br/>defend them, not necessarily because these values are right, but because if we<br/>
325<br/>

326<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
ignore them, we should do so only because they have been rejected—not by<br/>a court but by the people.<br/>
In cases where translation is not so simple (cases that have latent ambigu-<br/>
ities), judges, especially lower court judges, have a different role. In these<br/>cases, judges should kvetch. They should talk about the questions these<br/>changes raise, and they should identify the competing values at stake. Even if<br/>the decision they must adopt in a particular case is deferential or passive, it<br/>should be deferential in protest. These cases may well be a place for prudence,<br/>but to justify their passivity and compensate for allowing rights claims to fail,<br/>judges should raise before the legal culture the conflict presented by them.<br/>Hard cases need not make bad law, but neither should they be treated as if<br/>they are easy.<br/>
That is the simplest response to the problem of latent ambiguity. But it is<br/>
incomplete. It forces us to confront questions of constitutional value and to<br/>choose. A better solution would help resolve these questions. While it will<br/>never be the job of the courts to make final choices on questions of value, by<br/>raising these questions the courts may inspire others to decide them.<br/>
This is the idea behind the doctrine of a second look outlined twenty<br/>
years ago by Guido Calabresi, a professor at the time who is now a judge.2<br/>Brutally simplified, the idea is this: When the Supreme Court confronts<br/>issues that present open, yet fundamental questions of value, it should be<br/>open about the conflict and acknowledge that it is not plainly resolved by<br/>the Constitution. But the Court should nonetheless proceed to resolve it in<br/>the way most likely to induce democratic review of the resolution. If the res-<br/>olution induces the proper review, the Court should let stand the results of<br/>that review. The most the Court should do in such cases is ensure that<br/>democracy has its say; its job is not to substitute its values for the views of<br/>democrats.<br/>
Many ridicule this solution.3 Many argue that the framers clearly had<br/>
nothing like this in mind when they established a Supreme Court and permit-<br/>ted judicial review. Of course they did not have this in mind. The doctrine of<br/>a second look is not designed for the problems the framers had in mind. As a<br/>response to the problems of latent ambiguities, it itself reveals a latent ambi-<br/>guity.<br/>
We might deny this ambiguity. We might argue that the framers envi-<br/>
sioned that the Court would do nothing at all about latent ambiguities; that<br/>in such contexts the democratic process, through Article V, would step in to<br/>correct a misapplication or to respond to a changed circumstance. That may<br/>well have been their view. But I don’t think this intent is clear enough to fore-<br/>close our consideration of how we might best confront the coming series of<br/>

responses<br/>
327<br/>
questions on the application of constitutional value to cyberspace. I would<br/>rather err on the side of harmless activism than on the side of debilitating pas-<br/>sivity. It is a tiny role for courts to play in the much larger conversation we<br/>need to have—but to date have not started.<br/>
RESPONSES FOR CODE<br/>
A second challenge is confronting the law in code—resolving, that is, just<br/>how we think about the regulatory power of code. Here are a number of ideas<br/>that together would push us toward a world where regulation imposed<br/>through code would have to satisfy constitutional norms.<br/>
Here again is the link to open code. In Chapter 8, when I described a<br/>
kind of check that open code would impose on government regulation, I<br/>argued that it was harder for government to hide its regulations in open code,<br/>and easier for adopters to disable any regulations the government imposed.<br/>The movement from closed to open code was a movement from regulable to<br/>less regulable. Unless you are simply committed to disabling government’s<br/>power, this change cannot be unambiguously good.<br/>
But there are two parts to the constraint that open code might impose;<br/>
one is certainly good, and the other is not necessarily terrible. The first part is<br/>transparency—the regulations would be known. The second part is resist-<br/>ance—that known regulations could be more easily resisted. The second part<br/>need not follow from the first, and it need not be debilitating. It may be easier<br/>to disable the regulations of code if the code is in the open. But if the regula-<br/>tion is legitimate, the state can require that it not be disabled. If it wants, it can<br/>punish those who disobey.<br/>
Compare the regulation of seatbelts. For a time the federal government<br/>
required that new cars have automatic seatbelts. This was the regulation of<br/>code—the car would be made safer by regulating the code to force people to<br/>use seatbelts. Many people hated seatbelts, and some disabled them. But the<br/>virtue of the automatic seatbelt was that its regulation was transparent. No<br/>one doubted who was responsible for the rule the seatbelt imposed. If the<br/>state didn’t like it when people disabled their seatbelts, it was free to pass laws<br/>to punish them. In the end the government did not press the issue—not<br/>because it couldn’t, but because the political costs would have been too high.<br/>Politics checked the government’s regulation, just as it should.<br/>
This is the most we can expect of the regulation of code in cyberspace.<br/>
There is a trade-off between transparency and effectiveness. Code regulation<br/>in the context of open code is more transparent but also less binding. Govern-<br/>ment’s power to achieve regulatory ends would be constrained by open code.<br/>

328<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
There is another benefit. Closed code would make it easier for the govern-<br/>
ment to hide its regulation and thus achieve an illicit regulatory end. Thus,<br/>there is no simple defeat of government’s ends but instead a trade-off—<br/>between publicity and power, between the rules’ transparency and people’s<br/>obedience. It is an important check on government power to say that the only<br/>rules it should impose are those that would be obeyed if imposed transparently.<br/>
Does this mean that we should push for open rather than closed code?<br/>
Does it mean that we should ban closed code?<br/>
No. It does not follow from these observations that we should ban closed<br/>
code or that we must have a world with only open code. But they do point to<br/>the values we should insist on for any code that regulates. If code is a law-<br/>maker, then it should embrace the values of a particular kind of lawmaking.<br/>
The core of these values is transparency. What a code regulation does<br/>
should be at least as apparent as what a legal regulation does. Open code<br/>would provide that transparency—not for everyone (not everyone reads<br/>code), and not perfectly (badly written code hides its functions well), but<br/>more completely than closed code would.<br/>
Some closed code could provide this transparency. If code were more<br/>
modular—if a code writer simply pulled parts off the shelf to plug into her<br/>system, as if she were buying spark plugs for a car—then even if the code for<br/>these components was closed, the functions and regulation of the end product<br/>would be open.4 Componentized architecture could be as transparent as an<br/>open code architecture, and transparency could thus be achieved without<br/>opening the code.<br/>
The best code (from the perspective of constitutional values) is both<br/>
modular and open. Modularity ensures that better components could be sub-<br/>stituted for worse. And from a competitive perspective, modularity permits<br/>greater competition in the development of improvements in a particular cod-<br/>ing project.<br/>
It is plausible, however, that particular bits of code could not be produced<br/>
if they were produced as open code, that closed code may sometimes be nec-<br/>essary for competitive survival. If so, then the compromise of a component<br/>system would permit something of the best of both worlds—some competi-<br/>tive advantage along with transparency of function.<br/>
I’ve argued for transparent code because of the constitutional values it<br/>
embeds. I have not argued against code as a regulator or against regulation.<br/>But I have argued that we insist on transparency in regulation and that we<br/>push code structures to enhance that transparency.<br/>
The law presently does not do this. Indeed, as Mark Lemley and David<br/>
O’Brien argue, the existing structure of copyright protection for software<br/>

responses<br/>
329<br/>
tends to push the development of software away from a modular structure.5<br/>The law prefers opaque to transparent code; it constructs incentives to hide<br/>code rather than to make its functionality obvious.<br/>
Many have argued that the law’s present incentives are inefficient—that<br/>
they tend to reduce competition in the production of software.6 This may<br/>well be right. But the greater perversity is again constitutional. Our law creates<br/>an incentive to enclose as much of an intellectual commons as possible. It<br/>works against publicity and transparency, and helps to produce, in effect, a<br/>massive secret government.<br/>
Here is a place for concrete legal change. Without resolving the question<br/>
of whether closed or open code is best, we could at least push closed code in<br/>a direction that would facilitate greater transparency. But the inertia of exist-<br/>ing law—which gives software manufacturers effectively unlimited terms of<br/>protection—works against change. The politics are just not there.<br/>
RESPONSES OF A DEMOCRACY<br/>
In his rightly famous book <i>Profiles in Courage</i>, then-Senator John F. Kennedy<br/>tells the story of Daniel Webster, who, in the midst of a fight over a pact that<br/>he thought would divide the nation, said on the floor of the Senate, “Mr.<br/>President, I wish to speak today, not as a Massachusetts man, nor as a North-<br/>ern man, but as an American . . .”7<br/>
When Webster said this—in 1850—the words “not as a Massachusetts<br/>
man” had a significance that we are likely to miss today. To us, Webster’s state-<br/>ment seems perfectly ordinary. What else would he be but an American? How<br/>else would he speak?<br/>
But these words came on the cusp of a new time in the United States.<br/>
They came just at the moment when the attention of American citizens was<br/>shifting from their citizenship in a state to their citizenship in the nation.<br/>Webster spoke just as it was becoming possible to identify yourself apart from<br/>your state and as a member of a nation.<br/>
As I’ve said, at the founding citizens of the United States (a contested<br/>
concept itself) were citizens of particular states first. They were loyal to their<br/>own states because their lives were determined by where they lived. Other<br/>states were as remote to them as Tibet is to us—indeed, today it is easier for<br/>us to go to Tibet than it was then for a citizen of South Carolina to visit<br/>Maine.<br/>
Over time, of course, this changed. In the struggle leading up to the Civil<br/>
War, in the battles over Reconstruction, and in the revolution of industry<br/>that followed, individual citizens’ sense of themselves as Americans grew. In<br/>

330<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
those exchanges and struggles, a national identity was born. Only when citi-<br/>zens were engaged with citizens from other states was a nation created.<br/>
It is easy to forget these moments of transformation, and even easier to<br/>
imagine that they happen only in the past. Yet no one can deny that the sense<br/>of being “an American” shifted in the nineteenth century, just as no one can<br/>deny that the sense of being “a European” is shifting in Europe today. Nations<br/>are built as people experience themselves inside a common political culture.<br/>This change continues for us today.<br/>
We stand today just a few years before where Webster stood in 1850. We<br/>
stand on the brink of being able to say, “I speak as a citizen of the world,” with-<br/>out the ordinary person thinking, “What a nut.” We are just on the cusp of a<br/>time when ordinary citizens will begin to feel the effects of the regulations of<br/>other governments, just as the citizens of Massachusetts came to feel the<br/>effects of slavery and the citizens of Virginia came to feel the effects of a drive<br/>for freedom. As Nicholas Negroponte puts it, “Nations today are the wrong<br/>size. They are not small enough to be local and they are not large enough to<br/>be global.” 8 This misfit will matter.<br/>
As we, citizens of the United States, spend more of our time and money<br/>
in this space that is not part of any particular jurisdiction but subject to the<br/>regulations of all jurisdictions, we will increasingly ask questions about our<br/>status there. We will begin to feel the entitlement Webster felt, as an American,<br/>to speak about life in another part of the United States. For us, it will be the<br/>entitlement to speak about life in another part of the world, grounded in the<br/>feeling that there is a community of interests that reaches beyond diplomatic<br/>ties into the hearts of ordinary citizens.<br/>
What will we do then? When we feel we are part of a world, and that the<br/>
world regulates us? What will we do when we need to make choices about how<br/>that world regulates us, and how we regulate it?<br/>
The weariness with government that I described at the end of the last<br/>
chapter is not a condition without cause. But its cause is not the death of any<br/>ideal of democracy. We are all still democrats; we simply do not like what our<br/>democracy has produced. And we cannot imagine extending what we have to<br/>new domains like cyberspace. If there were just more of the same there—<br/>more of the excesses and betrayals of government as we have come to know<br/>it—then better that there should be less.<br/>
There are two problems here, though only one that is really tied to the<br/>
argument of this book, and so only one that I will discuss in any depth. The<br/>other I mentioned at the end of the last chapter—the basic corruption in any<br/>system that would allow so much political influence to be peddled by those who<br/>hand out money. This is the corruption of campaign financing, a corruption<br/>

responses<br/>
331<br/>
not of people but of process. Even good souls in Congress have no choice but<br/>to spend an ever-increasing amount of their time raising an ever-increasing<br/>amount of money to compete in elections. This is an arms race, and our<br/>Supreme Court has effectively said that the Constitution requires it. Until this<br/>problem is solved, I have little faith in what our democracy will produce.<br/>
The solution to this problem is obvious, even if the details are extremely<br/>
difficult: Spend public resources to fund public campaigns. The total cost of<br/>federal elections in 2004 was probably close to $4 billion.9 In the same year, we<br/>spent $384 billion on defense and $66 billion on the war in Iraq.10 Whatever<br/>you think about the wisdom of defense spending and the war in Iraq, at least<br/>the purposes of all three expenditures is the same—to preserve and promote<br/>democracy. Is there any doubt if we made campaign contributions essentially<br/>irrelevant to policy we’d have a more certain and positive effect on democracy<br/>than the other two?<br/>
But there is a second, oddly counterintuitive reason for this increasing<br/>
failure of democracy. This is not that government listens too little to the views<br/>of the public; it is that government listens too much. Every fancy of the pop-<br/>ulation gets echoed in polls, and these polls in turn pulse the democracy. Yet<br/>the message the polls transmit is not the message of democracy; their fre-<br/>quency and influence is not the product of increased significance. The Presi-<br/>dent makes policy on the basis of overnight polling only because overnight<br/>polling is so easy.<br/>
This is partly a technology problem. Polls mark an interaction of technol-<br/>
ogy and democracy that we are just beginning to understand. As the cost of<br/>monitoring the current view of the population drops, and as the machines for<br/>permanent monitoring of the population are built, we are producing a perpet-<br/>ual stream of data about what “the people” think about every issue that gov-<br/>ernment might consider.<br/>
A certain kind of code perfects the machine of monitoring—code that<br/>
automates perfect sample selection, that facilitates databases of results, and<br/>that simplifies the process of connecting. We rarely ask, however, whether<br/>perfect monitoring is a good.<br/>
It has never been our ideal—constitutionally at least—for democracy to<br/>
be a perfect reflection of the present temperature of the people. Our framers<br/>were keen to design structures that would mediate the views of the people.<br/>Democracy was to be more than a string of excited utterances. It was to be<br/>deliberative, reflective, and balanced by limitations imposed by a constitution.<br/>
But maybe, to be consistent with the arguments from Part III, I should<br/>
say that at least there was a latent ambiguity about this question. In a world<br/>where elections were extremely costly and communication was complicated,<br/>

332<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
democracy had to get by with infrequent elections. Nevertheless, we cannot<br/>really know how the framers would have reacted to a technology that allows<br/>perfect and perpetual polling.<br/>
There is an important reason to be skeptical of the flash pulse of the<br/>
people. The flash pulse is questionable not because the people are unedu-<br/>cated or incapable of good judgment, and not because democracy needs to<br/>fail, but because it is often the product of ignorance. People often have ill-<br/>informed or partially informed views that they simply repeat as judgments<br/>when they know that their judgments are not being particularly noticed or<br/>considered.<br/>
Technology encourages this. As a consequence of the massive increase in<br/>
reporting on news, we are exposed to a greater range of information about the<br/>world today than ever before. This exposure, in turn, gives us confidence in<br/>our judgment. Never having heard of East Timor, people when asked about it<br/>might well have said, “I don’t know.” But having seen ten seconds on TV, or<br/>thirty lines on a Web portal news page, gives them a spin they didn’t have<br/>before. And they repeat this spin, with very little value added.<br/>
The solution to this problem is not less news or a ban on polling. The<br/>
solution is a better kind of polling. The government reacts to bad poll data<br/>because that is the only data we have. But these polls are not the only possible<br/>kinds of polls. There are techniques for polling that compensate for the errors<br/>of the flash poll and produce judgments that are both more considered and<br/>more stable.<br/>
An example is the “deliberative” poll devised by Professor James Fishkin.<br/>
Rather than a pulse, Fishkin’s polls seek an equilibrium.11 They bring a cross-<br/>section of people together for a weekend at a time. These people, who repre-<br/>sent all segments of a society, are given information before the poll that helps<br/>ensure that they know something about the subject matter. After being intro-<br/>duced to the topic of the poll, they are then divided into small juries and over<br/>the course of a couple of days argue about the topic at issue and exchange<br/>views about how best to resolve it. At the end they are asked about their views,<br/>and their responses at this point form the “results” of the poll.<br/>
The great advantage of this system is not only that information is pro-<br/>
vided but that the process is deliberative. The results emerge out of the rea-<br/>soning of citizens debating with other citizens. People are not encouraged to<br/>just cast a ballot. They give reasons for their ballot, and those reasons will or<br/>will not persuade.<br/>
We could imagine (we could dream) of this process extending generally.<br/>
We could imagine it becoming a staple of our political life—maybe one rule<br/>of citizenship. And if it did, it might well do good, as a counterweight to the<br/>

responses<br/>
333<br/>
flash pulse and the perpetually interested process that ordinary government is.<br/>It would be a corrective to the process we now have, one that might bring<br/>hope.<br/>
Cyberspace might make this process more possible; it certainly makes it<br/>
even more necessary. It is possible to imagine using the architecture of the<br/>space to design deliberative forums, which could be used to implement<br/>Fishkin’s polling. But my message throughout is that cyberspace makes the<br/>need all the more urgent.12<br/>
There is a magic in a process where reasons count—not where experts<br/>
rule or where only smart people have the vote, but where power is set in the<br/>face of reason. The magic is in a process where citizens give reasons and<br/>understand that power is constrained by these reasons.<br/>
This was the magic that Tocqueville wrote of when he told the world of<br/>
the amazing system of juries in the United States. Citizens serving on juries<br/>must make reasoned, persuasive arguments in coming to decisions that often<br/>have extraordinary consequences for social and political life. Writing in 1835,<br/>Tocqueville said of juries:<br/>
The jury . . . serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the<br/>
citizens; and this spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest prepara-<br/>
tion for free institutions. It imbues all classes with a respect for the thing judged<br/>
and with the notion of right. . . . It teaches men to practice equity; every man<br/>
learns to judge his neighbor as he would himself be judged. . . . The jury teaches<br/>
every man not to recoil before the responsibility of his own actions and impresses<br/>
him with that manly confidence without which no political virtue can exist. It<br/>
invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy; it makes them all feel the duties<br/>
which they are bound to discharge towards society and the part which they take<br/>
in its government. By obliging men to turn their attention to other affairs than<br/>
their own, it rubs off that private selfishness which is the rust of society.13<br/>
It wasn’t Tocqueville, however, or any other theorist, who sold me on this<br/>
ideal. It was a lawyer who first let me see the power of this idea—a lawyer<br/>from Madison, Wisconsin, my uncle, Richard Cates.<br/>
We live in a time when the sane vilify lawyers. No doubt lawyers are in<br/>
part responsible for this. But I can’t accept it, and not only because I train<br/>lawyers for a living. I can’t accept it because etched into my memory is a pic-<br/>ture my uncle sketched, explaining why he was a lawyer. In 1974 he had just<br/>returned from Washington, where he worked for the House Committee on<br/>Impeachment—of Nixon, not Clinton, though Hillary Rodham was working<br/>with him. I pressed him to tell me everything; I wanted to hear about the<br/>

334<br/>

battles. It was not a topic that we discussed much at home. My parents were<br/>Republicans. My uncle was not.<br/>
My uncle’s job was to teach the congressmen about the facts in the case—<br/>
to first learn everything that was known, and then to teach this to the mem-<br/>bers of the committee. Although there was much about his story that I will<br/>never forget, the most compelling part was not really related to the impeach-<br/>ment. My uncle was describing for me the essence of his job—both for the<br/>House and for his clients:<br/>
It is what a lawyer does, what a good lawyer does, that makes this system work.<br/>
It is not the bluffing, or the outrage, or the strategies and tactics. It is something<br/>
much simpler than that. What a good lawyer does is tell a story that persuades.<br/>
Not by hiding the truth or exciting the emotion, but using reason, through a<br/>
story, to persuade.<br/>
When it works, it does something to the people who experience this per-<br/>
suasion. Some, for the first time in their lives, see power constrained by rea-<br/>son. Not by votes, not by wealth, not by who someone knows—but by an<br/>argument that persuades. This is the magic of our system, however rare the<br/>miracles may be.<br/>
This picture stuck—not in the elitist version of experts deciding what’s<br/>
best, nor in its populist version of excited crowds yelling opponents down, but<br/>in the simple version that juries know. And it is this simple picture that our<br/>current democracy misses. Where through deliberation, and understanding,<br/>and a process of building community, judgments get made about how to go<br/>on.<br/>
We could build some of this back into our democracy. The more we do,<br/>
the less significant the flash pulses will be. And the less significant these flash<br/>pulses are, the more we might have faith again in that part of our tradition<br/>that made us revolutionaries in 1789—the commitment to a form of govern-<br/>ment that respects deliberation and the people, and that stands opposed to<br/>corruption dressed in aristocratic baubles.<br/>

DECLAN MCCULLAGH IS A WRITER WHO WORKS FOR WIRED NEWS. HE ALSO RUNS<br/>a mailing list that feeds subscribers bulletins that he decides to forward and<br/>facilitates a discussion among these members. The list was originally called<br/>“Fight Censorship,” and it initially attracted a large number of subscribers<br/>who were eager to organize to resist the government’s efforts to “censor” the<br/>Net.<br/>
But Declan has converted the list to far more than a discussion of censor-<br/>
ship. He feeds to the list other news that he imagines his subscribers will<br/>enjoy. So in addition to news about efforts to eliminate porn from the Net,<br/>Declan includes reports on FBI wiretaps, or efforts to protect privacy, or the<br/>government’s efforts to enforce the nation’s antitrust laws. I’m a subscriber; I<br/>enjoy the posts.<br/>
Declan’s politics are clear. He’s a smart libertarian whose first reaction to<br/>
any suggestion that involves government is scorn. In one recent message, he<br/>cited a story about a British provider violating fax spam laws; this, he argued,<br/>showed that laws regulating e-mail spam are useless. In another, he criticized<br/>efforts by Reporters Without Borders to pass laws to protect free speech inter-<br/>nationally.1 There is one unifying theme to Declan’s posts: Let the Net alone.<br/>And with a sometimes self-righteous sneer, he ridicules those who question<br/>this simple, if powerful, idea.<br/>
I’ve watched Declan’s list for some time. For a brief time, long ago, I<br/>
watched the discussion part of the list as well. And throughout the years I have<br/>had the pleasure of learning from Declan, a single simple message has domi-<br/>nated the thread: The question is not just, Declan insists again and again,<br/>whether there are “market failures” that require government intervention.<br/>The question is also whether there are “government failures.” (As he said in a<br/>
335<br/>

336<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
recent post about the Reporters Without Borders, “[Julien Pain’s] able to iden-<br/>tify all these apparent examples of market failure, but [he’s] not as able to<br/>identify instances of <i>government </i>failure.”) And the consequence for Declan<br/>from asking the second is (just about always) to recommend we do nothing.<br/>
Declan’s question has a very good pedigree. It was the question Ronald<br/>
Coase first started asking as he worked toward his Nobel Prize. Economists<br/>such as Pigou had identified goods that markets couldn’t provide. That was<br/>enough for Pigou to show that governments should therefore step in. But as<br/>Coase said,<br/>
[I]n choosing between social arrangements within the context of which individ-<br/>
ual decisions are made, we have to bear in mind that a change in the existing sys-<br/>
tem which will lead to an improvement in some decisions may well lead to a<br/>
worsening of others. Furthermore we have to take into account the costs<br/>
involved in operating the various social arrangements (whether it be the work-<br/>
ing of a market or of a government department) as well as the costs involved in<br/>
moving to a new system. In devising and choosing between social arrangements<br/>
we should have regard for the total effect.2<br/>
Coase had a discipline to his work. That discipline was to never stop at<br/>
theory. Theoretical insight is critical to progress, but testing that theory with<br/>a bit of real-world life is critical as well.<br/>
But this is the trouble with the world of at least some libertarians. We can<br/>
speculate till the cows come home about what the world would be like if our<br/>government were crafted by a gaggle of pure libertarians. There would be a<br/>government, of course. Libertarians are not anarchists. And no doubt, the<br/>consequences of such a shift are counter-intuitive. It would certainly not be as<br/>bad as statists predict; I doubt it would be as good as libertarians promise.<br/>
But the reality is that we’re never going to live in libertarian land. And so<br/>
the question we should ask is what attitude we should bring to regulation,<br/><i>given we live in this world where regulation is going to happen</i>. Should our<br/>response in that world—meaning this world, and every possible world we’re<br/>ever going to see—be to act as if we oppose all regulation on principle?<br/>
Because if this is our response, that attitude will have an effect. It won’t<br/>
stop all regulation, but it will stop regulation of a certain form. Or, better, it’s<br/>certain <i>not </i>to stop regulation of a different form—regulation benefiting, for<br/>example, powerful special interests.<br/>
Consider an obvious example.<br/>Economists estimate that we as an economy lose billions because of the<br/>
burdens of spam. Ferris Research, for example, estimates that the current<br/>

what declan doesn’t get<br/>
337<br/>
costs (including lost productivity) are between $9 and $10 per user per<br/>month. That translates into more than $9 billion per year to fight spam.3<br/>These costs have been borne by everyone who pays for e-mail on the Internet.<br/>They don’t include the indirect costs of missing a message because it is either<br/>filtered or ignored. (Nor does this number reckon the benefit of spam, but as<br/>I won’t count the benefit in the comparative example either, I’ll leave that out<br/>for now.)<br/>
Economists have also tried to estimate the cost of Internet “piracy” of<br/>
copyrighted content (excluding software) to the content industry. Some esti-<br/>mate that the costs are actually very low. Felix Oberholzer and Koleman<br/>Strumpf, for example, concluded that filesharing has “an effect on sales statis-<br/>tically indistinguishable from zero.”4 Other estimates conclude there is a real<br/>loss, but not huge. In 2003, using a sophisticated model to measure the loss<br/>from P2P filesharing in 2003, David Blackburn concluded the industry lost<br/>$330 million.5 That number is significantly below the RIAA’s estimate of the<br/>total annual cost from “all forms of piracy”: $4.2 billion.6<br/>
Suffice it that these estimates are contested. But even so, in this field of<br/>
contest, one thing is absolutely certain: The cost of “piracy” is significantly less<br/>than the cost of spam. Indeed, the total cost of spam—adding consumers to<br/>corporations—exceeds the total annual revenues of the recording industry.7<br/>
So how does this difference in harm calibrate with what Congress has<br/>
done to respond to each of these two problems?<br/>
In the last ten years, Congress has passed exactly one bill to deal with the<br/>
problem of spam—the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. Over the same period, Con-<br/>gress has passed 24 laws affecting copyright.8 Not all of these laws, of course,<br/>are directly targeted against “piracy,” but they all do aim further to protect<br/>copyrighted work in a digital age.<br/>
This pattern is not an accident. In a political world that is dominated as<br/>
ours is, lawmaking happens when special interests benefit. It doesn’t happen<br/>when special interests oppose. And in these two instances, the lack of regula-<br/>tion and the plethora of regulation is explained by this point precisely. There<br/>have been 24 bills about copyright because rock stars lobby for them. There<br/>has been one bill about spam because the direct mailers (and many large<br/>companies) testified against them.<br/>
Now given this reality, I suggest the libertarian should recognize a third<br/>
important failure that complements “market” and “government” failure:<br/>There is “market failure” when markets can’t be expected to provide goods<br/>efficiently; there’s “government failure” when government can’t be expected to<br/>solve market failures efficiently; and there’s “libertarian failure” when the<br/>push to do nothing will produce not no regulation at all, but regulation by the<br/>

338<br/>
CODE 2.0<br/>
most powerful of special interests. Or in a slogan: When it’s wrong to push for<br/>regulation, only the wrong will get regulation.<br/>
I am not a libertarian in the sense Declan is, though I share his skepticism<br/>
about government. But we can’t translate skepticism into disengagement. We<br/>have a host of choices that will affect how the Internet develops and what<br/>values it will embed. The attitude that eschews government as part of those<br/>choices is not one that will stop government; it will simply stop government<br/>from making the right choices.<br/>
In my view, governments should intervene, at a minimum, when private<br/>
action has negative public consequences; when shortsighted actions threaten<br/>to cause long-term harm; when failure to intervene undermines significant<br/>constitutional values and important individual rights; when a form of life<br/>emerges that may threaten values we believe to be fundamental; and when we<br/>can see that failing to intervene on the side of right will simply strengthen the<br/>interventions on the side of wrong. Such intervention must be limited; it<br/>must be engaged with all the awareness about the failures of government that<br/>right thinking sorts can muster. But action defending right should not be<br/>stopped merely because some goes wrong. When those who believe in the<br/>liberty of cyberspace, and the values that liberty promotes, refuse to engage<br/>with government about how best to preserve those liberties, that weakens lib-<br/>erty. Do-nothingism is not an answer; something can and should be done.<br/>
I’ve argued this, but not with much hope. So central are the Declans in<br/>
our political culture today that I confess I cannot see a way around them. I<br/>have sketched small steps; they seem very small. I’ve described a different<br/>ideal; it seems quite alien. I’ve promised that something different could be<br/>done, but not by any institution of government that I know.<br/>
The truth, I suspect, is that the Declans will win—at least for now. We will<br/>
treat code-based environmental disasters—like the loss of privacy, like the<br/>censorship of censorware filters, like the disappearance of an intellectual com-<br/>mons—as if they were produced by gods, not by Man. We will watch as<br/>important aspects of privacy and free speech are erased by the emerging archi-<br/>tecture of the panopticon, and we will speak, like modern Jeffersons, about<br/>nature making it so—forgetting that here, we are nature. We will in many<br/>domains of our social life come to see the Net as the product of something<br/>alien—something we cannot direct because we cannot direct anything. Some-<br/>thing instead that we must simply accept, as it invades and transforms our<br/>lives.<br/>
Some say this is an exciting time. But it is the excitement of a teenager<br/>
playing chicken, his car barreling down the highway, hands held far from the<br/>steering wheel. There are choices we could make, but we pretend that there is<br/>

what declan doesn’t get<br/>
339<br/>
nothing we can do. We choose to pretend; we shut our eyes. We build this<br/>nature, then we are constrained by this nature we have built.<br/>
It is the age of the ostrich. We are excited by what we cannot know. We are<br/>
proud to leave things to the invisible hand. We make the hand invisible by<br/>looking the other way.<br/>
But it is not a great time, culturally, to come across revolutionary tech-<br/>
nologies. We are no more ready for this revolution than the Soviets were ready<br/>for theirs. We, like they, have been caught by a revolution. But we, unlike they,<br/>have something to lose.<br/>

A P P E N D I X<br/>
In Chapter 7, I sketched briefly an argument for how the four modalities I<br/>described constrain differently. In this appendix, I want to extend that argu-<br/>ment. My hope is to provide a richer sense of how these modalities—law, the<br/>market, norms, and architecture—interact as they regulate. Such an under-<br/>standing is useful, but not necessary, to the argument of this book. I’ve there-<br/>fore put it here, for those with an interest, and too much time. Elsewhere I<br/>have called this approach “the New Chicago School.”1<br/>
Law is a command backed up by the threat of a sanction. It commands<br/>
you not to commit murder and threatens a severe penalty if you do so anyway.<br/>Or it commands you not to trade in cocaine and threatens barbaric punish-<br/>ments if you do. In both cases, the picture of law is fairly simple and straight-<br/>forward: Don’t do this, or else.<br/>
Obviously law is much more than a set of commands and threats.2 Law<br/>
not only commands certain behaviors but expresses the values of a commu-<br/>nity (when, for example, it sets aside a day to celebrate the birth of Martin<br/>Luther King, Jr.);3 constitutes or regulates structures of government (when<br/>the Constitution, for example, establishes in Article I a House of Represen-<br/>tatives distinct from a Senate); and establishes rights that individuals can<br/>invoke against their own government (the Bill of Rights). All these are exam-<br/>ples of law, and by focusing on just one kind of law, I do not mean to dimin-<br/>ish the significance of these other kinds. Still, this particular aspect of law<br/>provides a well-defined constraint on individuals within the jurisdiction of<br/>the law giver, or sovereign. That constraint—objectively—is the threat of<br/>punishment.<br/>
Social norms constrain differently. By social norms, I mean those norma-<br/>
tive constraints imposed not through the organized or centralized actions of<br/>a state, but through the many slight and sometimes forceful sanctions that<br/>members of a community impose on each other. I am not talking about pat-<br/>terns of behavior: It may be that most people drive to work between 7:00 and<br/>8:00 A.M., but this is not a norm in the sense I mean. A norm governs socially<br/>salient behavior, deviation from which makes you socially abnormal.4<br/>
340<br/>

appendix<br/>
341<br/>
Life is filled with, constituted by, and defined in relation to such norms—<br/>
some of which are valuable, and many of which are not. It is a norm (and a<br/>good one) to thank others for service. Not thanking someone makes you<br/>“rude,” and being rude opens you up to a range of social sanctions, from<br/>ostracism to criticism. It is a norm to speak cautiously to a seatmate on an air-<br/>plane, or to stay to the right while driving slowly. Norms discourage men<br/>from wearing dresses to work and encourage all of us to bathe regularly. Ordi-<br/>nary life is filled with such commands about how we are to behave. For the<br/>ordinarily socialized person, these commands constitute a significant portion<br/>of the constraints on individual behavior.<br/>
Norms, like law, then, are effective rules. What makes norms different is<br/>
the mechanism and source of their sanction: They are imposed by a commu-<br/>nity, not a state. But they are similar to law in that, at least objectively, their<br/>constraint is imposed after a violation has occurred.<br/>
The constraints of the market are different again. The market constrains<br/>
through price. A price signals the point at which a resource can be transferred<br/>from one person to another. If you want a Starbucks coffee, you must give the<br/>clerk four dollars. The constraint (the four dollars) is simultaneous with the<br/>benefit you want (the coffee). You may, of course, bargain to pay for the ben-<br/>efit later (“I’d gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today”), but the obli-<br/>gation is incurred at the time you receive the benefit. To the extent that you<br/>stay in the market, this simultaneity is preserved. The market constraint,<br/>unlike law and norms, does not kick in after you have taken the benefit you<br/>seek; it kicks in at the same time.<br/>
This is not to say that market transactions cannot be translated into law<br/>
or norm transactions. Indeed, market transactions do not exist except within<br/>a context of law and norms. You must pay for your coffee; if you do not, the<br/>law of theft applies. Nothing in the market requires that you tip the waiter, but<br/>if you do not, norms kick in to regulate your stinginess. The constraints of the<br/>market exist because of an elaborate background of law and norms defining<br/>what is buyable and sellable, as well as rules of property and contract for how<br/>things may be bought and sold. But given these laws and norms, the market<br/>still constrains in a distinct way.<br/>
The constraint of our final modality is neither so contingent nor, in its full<br/>
range, so dependent. This is the constraint of architecture—the way the world<br/>is, or the ways specific aspects of it are. Architects call it the built environment;<br/>those who don’t give out names just recognize it as the world around them.<br/>
Plainly some of the constraints of architecture are constraints we have<br/>
made (hence the sense of “architecture”) and some are not. A door closes off<br/>a room. When locked, the door keeps you out. The constraint functions not<br/>

342<br/>
appendix<br/>
as law or norms do—you cannot ignore the constraint and suffer the conse-<br/>quence later. Even if the constraint imposed by the door is one you can over-<br/>come—by breaking it down perhaps, or picking the lock—the door still<br/>constrains, just not absolutely.<br/>
Some architectural constraints, however, are absolute. <i>Star Trek </i>notwith-<br/>
standing, we cannot travel at warp speed. We can travel fast, and technology<br/>has enabled us to travel faster than we used to. Nonetheless, we have good rea-<br/>son (or at least physicists do) for believing that there is a limit to the speed at<br/>which we can travel. As a T-shirt I saw at MIT put it, “186,282 miles per sec-<br/>ond. It’s not just a good idea. It’s the law.”<br/>
But whether absolute or not, or whether man-made or not, we can con-<br/>
sider these constraints as a single class—as the constraints of architecture, or<br/>real-space code. What unites this class is the agency of the constraint: No<br/>individual or group imposes the constraint, or at least not directly. Individuals<br/>are no doubt ultimately responsible for much of the constraint, but in its<br/>actual execution the constraint takes care of itself. Laws need police, prosecu-<br/>tors, and courts to have an effect; a lock does not. Norms require that individ-<br/>uals take note of nonconforming behavior and respond accordingly; gravity<br/>does not. The constraints of architecture are self-executing in a way that the<br/>constraints of law, norms, and the market are not.<br/>
This feature of architecture—self-execution—is extremely important for<br/>
understanding its role in regulation. It is particularly important for unseemly<br/>or unjust regulation. For example, to the extent that we can bring about effects<br/>through the automatic constraints of real-space code, we need not depend on<br/>the continued agency, loyalty, or reliability of individuals. If we can make the<br/>machine do it, we can be that much more confident that the unseemly will be<br/>done.<br/>
The launching of nuclear missiles is a nice example. In their original<br/>
design, missiles were to be launched by individual crews located within mis-<br/>sile launch silos. These men would have been ordered to launch their mis-<br/>siles, and the expectation was that they would do so. Laws, of course, backed<br/>up the order—disobeying the order to launch subjected the crew to court-<br/>martial.5<br/>
But in testing the system, the army found it increasingly unreliable.<br/>
Always the decision to launch was checked by a judgment made by an individ-<br/>ual, and always that individual had to decide whether the order was to be<br/>obeyed. Plainly this system is less reliable than a system where all the missiles<br/>are wired, as it were, to a single button on the President’s desk. But we might<br/>believe that there is value in this second check, that the agency of the action<br/>by the soldier ensures some check on the decision to launch.6<br/>

appendix<br/>
343<br/>
This is an important consequence of the automatic nature of the con-<br/>
straints of architecture. Law, norms, and the market are constraints checked<br/>by judgment. They are enacted only when some person or group chooses to<br/>do so. But once instituted, architectural constraints have their effect until<br/>someone stops them.<br/>
Agency, then, is one distinction between the four constraints. The tempo-<br/>
rality of the constraint—when it is imposed—is a second one.<br/>
Here I should distinguish between two different perspectives: that of<br/>
someone observing when a constraint is imposed (the objective perspective),<br/>and that of the person who experiences the constraint (the subjective perspec-<br/>tive). So far my description of the four constraints in this single model has<br/>been from the objective perspective. From that perspective they are quite dif-<br/>ferent, but from a subjective perspective they need not differ at all.<br/>
From the objective perspective the difference is between constraints that<br/>
demand payment up front and constraints that let you play and then pay.<br/>Architecture and the market constrain up front; law and norms let you play<br/>first. For example, think of the constraints blocking your access to the air-<br/>conditioned home of a neighbor who is gone for the weekend. Law con-<br/>strains you—if you break in, you will be trespassing. Norms constrain you as<br/>well—it’s not neighborly to break into your neighbor’s house. Both of these<br/>constraints, however, would be imposed on you after you broke into the<br/>house. They are prices you might have to pay later.7 The architectural con-<br/>straint is the lock on the door—it blocks you as you are trying to enter the<br/>house. The market constrains your ownership of an air conditioner in the<br/>same way—it demands money before it will give you one. From an objective<br/>perspective, what distinguishes these two classes of constraints is their tem-<br/>porality—when the sanction is imposed.<br/>
From a subjective perspective, however, all these differences may disap-<br/>
pear. Subjectively, you may well feel a norm constraint long before you violate<br/>it. You may feel the constraint against breaking into your neighbor’s house just<br/>at the thought of doing so. A constraint may be objectively <i>ex post, </i>but expe-<br/>rienced subjectively <i>ex ante</i>.<br/>
The point is not limited to norms. Think about a child and fire. Fire is a<br/>
bit of real-space code: The consequences are felt as soon as the constraint it<br/>imposes is violated. A child learns this the first time he puts his hand near a<br/>flame. Thereafter, the child internalizes the constraint of fire before putting his<br/>hand in one. Burned once, the child knows not to put his hand so near the<br/>flame a second time.8<br/>
We can describe this change as the development of a subjective constraint<br/>
on the child’s behavior. We can then see how the idea extends to other con-<br/>

344<br/>
appendix<br/>
straints. Think about the stock market. For those who do not shop very much,<br/>the constraints of the market may indeed be only the objective constraint of<br/>the price demanded when they make a purchase. However, for those who<br/>experience the market regularly—who have, as it were, a sense of the mar-<br/>ket—the constraints of the market are quite different. Such people come to<br/>know them as a second nature, which guides or constrains their actions.<br/>Think of a stockbroker on the floor of an exchange. To be a great broker is to<br/>come to know the market “like the back of your hand,” to let it become second<br/>nature. In the terms that we’ve used, this broker has let the market become<br/>subjectively part of who she is.<br/>
Each constraint, then, has a subjective and an objective aspect. Laws are<br/>
objectively ex post, but for most of us, the fact that a law directs us in a par-<br/>ticular way is sufficient to make it a subjective constraint. (It is not the objec-<br/>tive threat of jail that constrains me from cheating on my taxes; instead, I<br/>have made subjective the constraints of the law with respect to taxes. Honest,<br/>IRS. This is true.) As a subjective constraint, it constrains us before we act.<br/>
For those who are fully mature, or fully integrated, all objective con-<br/>
straints are subjectively effective prior to their actions. They feel the con-<br/>straints of real-space code, of law, of norms, and of the market before they act.<br/>For the completely immature, or totally alienated, few objective constraints<br/>are subjectively effective. They step in the mud and only then learn about the<br/>constraint of mud; they steal bread and only then learn about the punish-<br/>ments of the law; they show up at a wedding in cut-offs and only then learn<br/>about the scorn of their friends; they spend all their money on candy and only<br/>then learn of the constraint of market scarcity. These two types mark out the<br/>extremes; most of us are somewhere in between.<br/>
The more subjective a constraint, then, the more effective it is in regulat-<br/>
ing behavior. It takes work to make a constraint subjective. An individual<br/>must choose to make it a part of who he or she is. To the extent that the norm<br/>is made subjective, it constrains simultaneously with the behavior it regu-<br/>lates.<br/>
This points to one final distinction between law and norms, on the one<br/>
hand, and real-space code, on the other. Law and norms are more efficient the<br/>more subjective they are, but they need some minimal subjectivity to be effec-<br/>tive at all. The person constrained must know of the constraint. A law that<br/>secretly punishes people for offenses they do not know exist would not be<br/>effective in regulating the behavior it punishes.9<br/>
But this is not the case with architecture. Architecture can constrain with-<br/>
out any subjectivity. A lock constrains the thief whether or not the thief knows<br/>that it is a lock blocking the door. The distance between two places constrains<br/>

appendix<br/>
345<br/>
the intercourse between those two places whether or not anyone in those<br/>places understands that constraint. This point is a corollary of the point about<br/>agency: Just as a constraint need not be imposed by an agent, neither does the<br/>subject need to understand it.<br/>
Architectural constraints, then, work whether or not the subject knows<br/>
they are working, while law and norms work only if the subject knows some-<br/>thing about them. If the subject has internalized them, they can constrain<br/>whether or not the expected cost of complying exceeds the benefit of deviat-<br/>ing. Law and norms can be made more code-like the more they are internal-<br/>ized, but internalization takes work.<br/>
Though I have used language invoking architects, my language is not the<br/>
language of architects. It is instead stolen and bent. I am not a scholar of<br/>architecture, but I have taken from architecture its insight about the relation-<br/>ship between the built environment and the practices that environment cre-<br/>ates.10 Neither architects nor I take this relationship to be determinative.<br/>Structure X does not determine behavior Y. Instead, these forms are always<br/>influences that can change, and when they are changed, they alter the affected<br/>behavior.<br/>
Like Michael Sorkin, I believe that “meanings inhere in forms, and that<br/>
the settings for social life can aid its fulfillment.” His book <i>Local Code: The<br/>Constitution of a City at 42N Latitude </i>suggests each feature of the model I am<br/>describing, including the ambiguity between law and architecture (building<br/>codes) and the constitution the two enable. Whatever the source of the con-<br/>tent of these codes, he writes, “their consequences are built.”11 This is the fea-<br/>ture to focus on.<br/>
My suggestion is that if we relativize regulators—if we understand how<br/>
the different modalities regulate and how they are subject, in an important<br/>sense, to law—then we will see how liberty is constructed, not simply through<br/>the limits we place on law, but by structures that preserve a space for individ-<br/>ual choice, however that choice may be constrained.<br/>
We are entering a time when our power to muck about with the<br/>
structures that regulate is at an all-time high. It is imperative, then, that we<br/>understand just what to do with this power. And, more importantly, what<br/>not to do with it.<br/>

6. “MUD” has had a number of meanings, originally Multi-User Dungeon, or Multi-User<br/>
Domain. A MOO is a “MUD, object-oriented.” Sherry Turkle’s analysis of life in a MUD or<br/>MOO, <i>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet </i>(New York: Simon and Schuster,<br/>1995), is still a classic. See also Elizabeth Reid, “Hierarchy and Power: Social Control in Cyber-<br/>space,” in <i>Communities in Cyberspace, </i>edited by Marc A. Smith and Peter Kollock (New York:<br/>Routledge, 1999), 107. The father—or god—of a MUD named LambdaMOO is Pavel Curtis. See<br/>his account in “Mudding: Social Phenomena in Text-Based Virtual Realities,” in Stefik, <i>Internet<br/>Dreams, </i>265–92.

7. This is not a rare feature of these spaces. It is indeed quite common, at least within role-<br/>
playing games. Julian Dibbell described to me a “parable” he recognized within Ultima Online:<br/>As he calls it, the “case of the stolen Bone Crusher.”<br/>
“I got two offers for a Bone Crusher, which is a powerful sort of mace for bopping<br/>monsters over the head. I started dealing with both of them. At a certain point I<br/>

notes to chapter two<br/>
349<br/>
was informed by one of them that the Bone Crusher had been stolen. So I said,<br/>‘I’ll go buy it from the other guy. But, by the way, who was it that stole the Bone<br/>Crusher, do you know?’ He said the name of the other guy. I was faced with this<br/>dilemma of was I going to serve as a fence for this other guy knowingly. And so,<br/>I turned to my mentor in this business, the guy who had been doing this for<br/>years and makes six figures a year on it, and, you know, I thought of him as an<br/>honest guy. So I sort of thought and maybe even hoped that he would just say just<br/>walk away. We don’t do these kinds of deals in our business. We don’t need that,<br/>you know, blah, blah, blah. But he said, ‘Well, you know, thieving is built into the<br/>game. It is a skill that you can do. So fair is fair.’ It is in the code that you can go<br/>into somebody’s house and practice your thieving skills and steal something from<br/>them. And so, I went ahead and did the deal but there was this lingering sense of,<br/>‘Wow, in a way that is completely arbitrary that this ability is in the code here<br/>whereas, you know, if it wasn’t built into the code it would be another story; they<br/>would have stolen it in another way.’ . . .”<br/>
“But in Ultima Online, it is very explicitly understood that the code allows<br/>
you to steal and the rules allow you to steal. For me what was interesting was that<br/>there remains this gray area. It made it an interesting game, that you were allowed<br/>to do something that was actually morally shady and you might have to decide for<br/>yourself. I’m not sure that now, going back to the deal, I would have taken the<br/>fenced item. I’ve been stolen from in the game, according to the rules, and it feels<br/>like shit.”<br/>

6. As network adminstrator Greg Jackson described to me, while certain ports (including<br/>
the wireless network) require that the user initially register the machine, there is no ongoing<br/>effort to verify the identity of the user. And, more importantly, there are still a significant num-<br/>ber of ports which remain essentially unregulated. That doesn’t mean that usage, however,<br/>isn’t regulated. As Jackson described,<br/>
“But the truth is, if we can identify a particular peer-to-peer network that is doing<br/>huge movie sharing, we will assign it a lower priority so it simply moves slower and<br/>doesn’t interfere with other people. So, we do a lot of packet shaping of that sort.<br/>Almost never does that extend to actually blocking particular sites, for example,<br/>although there are a few cases where we have had to do that just because . . .”<br/>
According to Jackson, it is now Columbia that earns the reputation as the free-est network.<br/>
“Columbia . . . really doesn’t ever try to monitor at all who gets on the wired network on cam-<br/>pus. They just don’t bother with that. Their policy is that they protect applications, not the net-<br/>work.”<br/>

8. Peter Steiner, cartoon, <i>New Yorker, </i>July 5, 1993, 61.<br/>9. In some contexts we call a network architecture that solves some of these “imperfec-<br/>
tions”—that builds in these elements of control—an intranet. Intranets are the fastest-growing<br/>portion of the Internet today. They are a strange hybrid of two traditions in network comput-<br/>ing—the open system of the Internet, based on TCP/IP, and the control-based capability of tra-<br/>ditional proprietary networks layered onto the Internet. Intranets mix values from each to<br/>produce a network that is interoperable but gives its controller more control over access than<br/>anyone would have over the Internet. My argument in this book is that an “internet” with con-<br/>trol is what our Internet is becoming.<br/>

Party Encryption,” <i>World Wide Web Journal </i>2 (1997): 241, 245: “Although cryptography has tra-<br/>ditionally been associated with confidentiality, other cryptographic mechanisms, such as<br/>authentication codes and digital signatures, can assure that messages have not been tampered<br/>with or forged.”<br/>

<i>Transactions on Information Theory it–22 </i>(November 1976): 29–40. The idea had apparently<br/>been discovered earlier by James Ellis at the British Government Communication Headquar-<br/>ters, but it was not then published; see Baker and Hurst, <i>The Limits of Trust, </i>xvii–xviii.<br/>
15. Even if the wires are tapped, this type of encryption still achieves its magic. We can get<br/>
a hint of how in a series of cases whose accumulating impact makes the potential clear.<br/>
A. If I want to send a message to you that I know only you will be able to read, I can take<br/>
your public key and use it to encrypt that message. Then I can send that message to you know-<br/>ing that only the holder of the private key (presumably you) will be able to read it. Advantage:<br/>My message to you is secure. Disadvantage: You can’t be sure it is I who sent you the message.<br/>Because anyone can encrypt a message using your public key and then send it to you, you<br/>have no way to be certain that I was the one who sent it. Therefore, consider the next example.<br/>
B. Before I send the message I have encrypted with your public key, I can encrypt it with<br/>
my private key. Then when you receive the message from me, you can first decrypt it with my<br/>public key, and then decrypt it again with your private key. After the first decryption, you can<br/>be sure that I (or the holder of my private key) was the one who sent you the message; after the<br/>second decryption, you can be sure that only you (or other holders of your private key) actually<br/>read the content of the message. But how do you know that what I say is the public key of Larry<br/>Lessig is actually the public key of Larry Lessig? How can you be sure, that is, that the public key<br/>you are using is actually the public key it purports to be? Here is where the next example<br/>comes in.<br/>
C. If there is a trustworthy third party (say, my bank, or the Federal Reserve Board, or the<br/>
ACLU) with a public key (a fact I am able to verify because of the prominence of the institu-<br/>tion), and that third party verifies that the public key of Larry Lessig is actually the public key<br/>of Larry Lessig, then along with my message sent to you, encrypted first in your public key and<br/>second in my private key, would be a certificate, issued by that institution, itself encrypted<br/>with the institution’s private key. When you receive the message, you can use the institution’s<br/>public key to decrypt the certificate; take from the certificate my public key (which you now are<br/>fairly confident is my public key); decrypt the message I sent you with the key held in the cer-<br/>tificate (after which you are fairly confident comes from me); and then decrypt the message<br/>encrypted with your public key (which you can be fairly confident no one else has read). If we<br/>did all that, you would know that I am who I say I am and that the message was sent by me; I<br/>would know that only you read the message; and you would know that no one else read the<br/>message along the way.<br/>

tion will be needed to effect important public values. See, e.g., Thomas B. Nachbar, “Paradox<br/>and Structure: Relying on Government Regulation to Preserve the Internet’s Unregulated<br/>Character,” <i>Minnesota Law Review </i>85 (2000): 215 (suggesting intervention needed); Neil<br/>Weinstock Netanel, “Cyberspace Self-Governance: A Skeptical View from Liberal Democratic<br/>Theory,” <i>California Law Review </i>88 (2000): 395 (surveying and emphasizing democratic delib-<br/>eration); Jay P.

10. This is just what happened, Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Richard<br/>
Posner argues, when the Warren Court constitutionalized criminal procedure. To compen-<br/>sate for the increased difficulty in convicting a criminal, Congress radically increased crim-<br/>inal punishments. See Richard A. Posner, “The Cost of Rights: Implications for Central and<br/>Eastern Europe—and for the United States,” <i>Tulsa Law Journal </i>32 (1996): 1, 7–9. Professor<br/>William Stuntz has made a similar point. William J. Stuntz, “The Uneasy Relationship<br/>Between Criminal Procedure and Criminal Justice,” <i>Yale Law Journal </i>107 (1997): 1, 4. The<br/>Constitution, in this story, acted as an exogenous constraint to which Congress could adjust.<br/>If the protections of the Constitution increased, then Congress could compensate by increas-<br/>ing punishments.<br/>
11. Initially, the CALEA requirements extended to “facilities based” VOIP services only,<br/>
though the push more recently is to extend it to all VOIP services. See Daniel J. Solove, Marc<br/>Rotenberg, and Paul M. Schwartz, <i>Information Privacy Law, </i>2nd edition (New York: Aspen<br/>Publishers, 2006), they summarize the VOIP situation on pp. 287–88: “Voice over Internet<br/>Protocol (VoIP).”<br/>
12. See Federal Communications Commission, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,<br/>
Released November, 5 1998, at p. 25 (“In the matter of: Communications Assistance for Law<br/>Enforcement Act”) (“J-STD-025 includes a ‘location’ parameter that would identify the location<br/>of a subject’s ‘mobile terminal’ whenever this information is reasonably available at the inter-<br/>cept access point and its delivery to law enforcement is legally authorized. Location information<br/>would be available to the LEA irrespective of whether a call content channel or a call data<br/>channel was employed.”). The FBI’s desire to gather this information was challenged by civil<br/>liberties groups and industry associations. See <i>United States Telecom Association, et al. v. FCC,<br/></i>227 F.3d 450 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The Court permitted the cell tower information to be revealed,<br/>but only with a more substantial burden placed on the government.<br/>

24. Former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, for example, has called a national ID<br/>
card “an infringement on rights of Americans”; see Ann Devroy, “Thornburgh Rules Out<br/>Two Gun Control Options; Attorney General Objects to Registration Card for Gun Owners,<br/>National Identification Card,” <i>Washington Post, </i>June 29, 1989, A41. The Immigration Reform<br/>and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–603, 100 Stat 3359 [1986], 8 USC 1324a[c] [1988])<br/>eschews it: “Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize directly or indirectly, the<br/>issuance or use of national identification cards or the establishment of national identification<br/>cards.” Given the power of the network to link data, however, this seems to me an empty pro-<br/>tection. See also Real ID Act, Pub. L. No. 109–13, Title II §202 (2005). The Real ID Act<br/>requires citizens to go to the DMV in person, bringing with them several pieces of identifi-<br/>cation to the DMV, including birth certificates, and face consumers with higher fees and<br/>tougher background check. Supporters feel the act targets the link between terrorists, illegal<br/>immigrants, and identification standards.<br/>
25. Jack Goldsmith and Timothy Wu, “Digital Borders,” <i>Legal Affairs, </i>Jan./Feb. 2006, 44.<br/>26. Notice that this would be an effective end-run around the protections that the Court<br/>
recognized in <i>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, </i>117 SCt 2329 (1997). There are many<br/>“activities” on the Net that Congress could easily regulate (such as gambling). Regulation of<br/>these activities could require IDs before access to these activities would be permitted. To the<br/>extent that such regulation increases the incidence of IDs on the Net, other speech-related<br/>access conditions would become easier to justify.<br/>
27. Arthur Cordell and T. Ran Ide have proposed the consideration of a bit tax; see<br/>
Arthur J. Cordell et al., <i>The New Wealth of Nations: Taxing Cyberspace </i>(Toronto: Between the<br/>Lines, 1997). Their arguments are compelling from the perspective of social justice and eco-<br/>nomics, but what they do not account for is the architecture that such a taxing system would<br/>require. A Net architected to meter a bit tax could be architected to meter just about any-<br/>thing.<br/>

28. Countries with such a requirement have included Argentina, Australia, Belgium,<br/>
Greece, Italy, and Switzerland; see Richard L. Hasen, “Symposium: Law, Economics, and<br/>Norms: Voting Without Law?” <i>University of Pennsylvania Law Review </i>144 (1996): 2135.<br/>

<i>Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution, </i>edited by Chris DiBona et al. (Sebastopol,<br/>Cal.: O’Reilly and Associates, 1999).<br/>
30. Michael Froomkin makes a similar point: “Export control rules have had an effect on<br/>
the domestic market for products with cryptographic capabilities such as e-mail, operating sys-<br/>tems, and word processors. Largely because of the ban on export of strong cryptography, there<br/>is today no strong mass-market standard cryptographic product within the U.S. even though<br/>a considerable mathematical and programming base is fully capable of creating one”; “It Came<br/>from Planet Clipper,” 19.<br/>
31. See “Network Associates and Key Recovery,” available at link #32.<br/>32. Cisco has developed products that incorporate the use of network-layer encryption<br/>
through the IP Security (IPSec) protocol. For a brief discussion of IPSec, see Cisco Systems,<br/>Inc., “IP Security–IPSec Overview,” available at link #33.

33. See Internet Architectural Board statement on “private doorbell” encryption, available<br/>

34. Little, but not nothing. Through conditional spending grants, the government was<br/>
quite effective initially in increasing Net participation, and it was effective in resisting the<br/>development of encryption technologies; see Whitfield Diffie and Susan Eva Landau, <i>Privacy<br/>on the Line: The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption </i>(Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1998).<br/>Steven Levy tells of a more direct intervention. When Richard Stallman refused to password-<br/>protect the MIT AI (artificial intelligence) machine, the Department of Defense threatened to<br/>take the machine off the Net unless the architectures were changed to restrict access. For Stall-<br/>man, this was a matter of high principle; for the Department of Defense, it was business as<br/>usual; see Steven Levy, <i>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution </i>(Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor<br/>Press/Doubleday, 1984), 416–18.<br/>

1. Mike Godwin, <i>Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age </i>(New York: Times<br/>
Books, 1998), 15. See also Esther Dyson, <i>Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age<br/></i>(New York: Broadway Books, 1997), who asserts: “Used right, the Internet can be a powerful<br/>enabling technology fostering the development of communities because it supports the very<br/>thing that creates a community—human interaction” (32); see also Stephen Doheny-Farina,<br/><i>The Wired Neighborhood </i>(New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1996), 121–37. For an<br/>important collection examining community in cyberspace, see Marc A. Smith and Peter Kol-<br/>lock, <i>Communities in Cyberspace </i>(New York: Routledge, 1999). The collection ranges across the<br/>social issues of community, including “social order and control,” “collective action,” “commu-<br/>nity structure and dynamics,” and “identity.” The same relationship between architecture and<br/>norms assumed in this chapter guides much of the analysis in Smith and Kollock’s collection.<br/>
2. As I explored in <i>Code </i>v1, the newest “communitarian” on the Net might be business. A<br/>
number of influential works have argued that the key to success with online businesses is the<br/>development of “virtual communities”; see, for example, Larry Downes and Chunka Mui,<br/><i>Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market Dominance </i>(Boston: Harvard Business<br/>School Press, 1998), 101–9; John Hagel and Arthur G. Armstrong, Net Gain: Expanding Mar-<br/>kets Through Virtual Communities (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1997). The explo-<br/>sion of essentially community based entities, such as Wikipedia and MySpace, in the time<br/>since confirms the insight of these authors.<br/>

Ramo in part 4 of Richard Holeton, <i>Composing Cyberspace: Identity, Community, and Knowl-<br/>edge in the Electronic Age </i>(Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1998). Howard Rheingold’s book (the first<br/>chapter of which is excerpted in Holeton’s book) is also an early classic; see <i>The Virtual Com-<br/>munity: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier </i>(Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1993). Stacy<br/>Horn’s book is a brilliant text taken more directly from the interchange (and more) online; see<br/><i>Cyberville: Clicks, Culture, and the Creation of an Online Town </i>(New York: Warner Books,<br/>1998).<br/>
5. For an excellent description, see Jonathan Zittrain, “The Rise and Fall of Sysopdom,”<br/>

6. As Steven Johnson puts it: “In theory, these are examples of architecture and urban<br/>
planning, but in practice they are bound up in broader issues: each design decision echoes and<br/>amplifies a set of values, an assumption about the larger society that frames it”; <i>Interface Cul-<br/>ture: How New Technology Transforms the Way We Create and Communicate </i>(San Francisco:<br/>Harper, 1997), 44.

<i>losophy and Other Arts and Sciences, </i>edited by Nelson Goodman and Catherine Z. Elgin (Lon-<br/>don: Routledge, 1988), 31–48. The same insight applies to things as well as spaces. See Langdon<br/>Winner, “Do Artifacts Have Politics?,” in <i>The Whale and the Reactor: A Search for Limits in an<br/>Age of High Technology </i>(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), 19–39. To say a space or<br/>thing has values, however, does not say it determines any particular result. Influences and<br/>agency are many.<br/>
7. Mark Stefik, <i>The Internet Edge, </i>14–15.<br/>8. Cf. Godwin, <i>Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age </i>(New York: Times<br/>
Books, 1998): (“If you’re face-to-face with someone, you’re exposed to countless things over<br/>which the other person may have had no conscious control—hair color, say, or facial expres-<br/>sions. But when you’re reading someone’s posted ASCII message, everything you see is a prod-<br/>uct of that person’s mind”) 42; see also ibid., 44.<br/>

<i>Lotus, Marketplace, and the Clipper Chip </i>(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997), 12–16.<br/>Gurak notes that “pseudonyms, for example, can be used to mask the name of a speaker, so<br/>that often it is the ethos of the texts, not the character of the speaker, that does or does not<br/>convince others.” Cf. Lori Kendall, “MUDder? I Hardly Know ’Er!: Adventures of a Feminist<br/>MUDder,” in <i>Wired Women: Gender and New Realities in Cyberspace, </i>edited by Lynn Cherny<br/>and Elizabeth Reba Weise (Seattle: Seal Press, 1996), 207–233. Godwin describes another pos-<br/>sibility, as the ASCII channel on the Net shuts down: “Then, perhaps, the world of ASCII com-<br/>munications will become a preserve for the edgy exchanges of tense text maniacs. Like me”;<br/><i>Cyber Rights, </i>45.<br/>
11. This is what economists would call a “separating equilibrium”: “players of different<br/>
types adopt different strategies and thereby allow an uninformed player to draw inferences<br/>about an informed player’s type from that player’s actions”; Douglas G. Baird, Robert H.<br/>Gertner, and Randal C. Picker, <i>Game Theory and the Law </i>(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Uni-<br/>versity Press, 1994), 314. William Mitchell argues that the advance back to synchronous<br/>communication is not necessarily an advantage: “As much more efficient asynchronous com-<br/>munications systems have become commonplace, though, we have seen that strict synchrony<br/>is not always desirable; controlled asynchrony may have its advantages”; <i>City of Bits, </i>5–16.<br/>

suality: There is a difference between affection and vulgarity. There is also a difference<br/>between a discussion of the health or emotional aspects of sex using appropriate language,<br/>and more crude conversations about sex. The former is acceptable, the latter is not. For<br/>example, in a discussion about forms of cancer, the words breast or testicular would be<br/>acceptable, but slang versions of those words would not be acceptable anywhere. Violence<br/>and Drug Abuse: Graphic images of humans being killed, such as in news accounts, may be<br/>acceptable in some areas, but blood and gore, gratuitous violence, etc., are not acceptable.<br/>Discussions about coping with drug abuse in health areas are okay, but discussions about or<br/>depictions of illegal drug abuse that imply it is acceptable are not.”<br/>

CHAPTER SEVEN<br/>
1. Or more precisely, against a certain form of government regulation. The more powerful<br/>
libertarian arguments against regulation in cyberspace are advanced, for example, by Peter<br/>Huber in <i>Law and Disorder in Cyberspace. </i>Huber argues against agency regulation and in favor<br/>of regulation by the common law. See also Thomas Hazlett in “The Rationality of U.S. Regu-<br/>lation of the Broadcast Spectrum,” <i>Journal of Law and Economics </i>33 (1990): 133, 133–39. For<br/>a lawyer, it is hard to understand precisely what is meant by “the common law.” The rules of the<br/>common law are many, and the substantive content has changed. There is a common law<br/>process, which lawyers like to mythologize, in which judges make policy decisions in small<br/>spaces against the background of binding precedent. It might be this that Huber has in mind,<br/>and if so, there are, of course, benefits to this system. But as he plainly understands, it is a<br/>form of regulation even if it is constituted differently.<br/>
2. The primary examples are the convictions under the Espionage Act of 1917; see, for<br/>
example, <i>Schenck v. United States, </i>249 US 47 (1919) (upholding conviction for distributing a<br/>leaflet attacking World War I conscription); <i>Frohwerk v. United States, </i>249 US 204 (1919)<br/>(upholding conviction based on newspaper alleged to cause disloyalty); <i>Debs v. United States,<br/></i>249 US 211 (1919) (conviction upheld for political speech said to cause insubordination and<br/>disloyalty).<br/>
3. See, for example, the work of John R. Commons, <i>Legal Foundations of Capitalism</i><br/>
(1924), 296–98, discussed in Herbert Hovenkamp, <i>Enterprise and American Law, 1836–1937</i><br/>

4. The general idea is that the tiny corrections of space enforce a discipline, and that this<br/>
discipline is an important regulation. Such theorizing is a tiny part of the work of Michel Fou-<br/>cault; see <i>Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison </i>(New York: Vintage, 1979), 170–77,<br/>though his work generally inspires this perspective. It is what Oscar Gandy speaks about in <i>The<br/>Panoptic Sort: A Political Economy of Personal Information </i>(Boulder: Westview Press, 1993), 23.<br/>David Brin makes the more general point that I am arguing—that the threat to liberty is<br/>broader than a threat by the state; see <i>The Transparent Society, </i>110.<br/>
5. See, for example, <i>The Built Environment: A Creative Inquiry into Design and Planning,</i><br/>
edited by Tom J. Bartuska and Gerald L. Young (Menlo Park, Cal.: Crisp Publications, 1994);<br/><i>Preserving the Built Heritage: Tools for Implementation, </i>edited by J. Mark Schuster et al.<br/>(Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1997). In design theory, the notion I am<br/>describing accords with the tradition of Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk; see, for<br/>example, William Lennertz, “Town-Making Fundamentals,” in <i>Towns and Town-Making Prin-<br/>ciples, </i>edited by Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (New York: Rizzoli, 1991): “The<br/>work of . . . Duany and . . . Plater-Zyberk begins with the recognition that design affects behav-<br/>ior. [They] see the structure and function of a community as interdependent. Because of this,<br/>they believe a designer’s decisions will permeate the lives of residents not just visually but in the<br/>way residents live. They believe design structures functional relationships, quantitatively and<br/>qualitatively, and that it is a sophisticated tool whose power exceeds its cosmetic attributes”<br/>(21).<br/>
6. Elsewhere I’ve called this the “New Chicago School”; see Lawrence Lessig, “The New<br/>
Chicago School,” <i>Journal of Legal Studies </i>27 (1998): 661. It is within the “tools approach” to gov-<br/>ernment action (see John de Monchaux and J. Mark Schuster, “Five Things to Do,” in Schuster,<br/><i>Preserving the Built Heritage, </i>3), but it describes four tools whereas Schuster describes five. I<br/>develop the understanding of the approach in the Appendix to this book.<br/>
7. These technologies are themselves affected, no doubt, by the market. Obviously, these<br/>

22. See <i>Rummel v. Estelle, </i>445 US 263, 274 n.11 (1980).<br/>23. Interestingly—and again, a reason to see the future of regulation talk located else-<br/>
where—this is not true of architects. An example is the work of John de Monchaux and J.<br/>Mark Schuster. In their essay “Five Things to Do” and in the collection that essay introduces,<br/><i>Preserving the Built Heritage, </i>they describe the “five and only five things that governments can<br/>do—five distinct tools that they can use—to implement their” policies (4–5): ownership and<br/>operation (the state may own the resource); regulation (of either individuals or institutions);<br/>incentives; property rights; information. Monchaux and Schuster’s five tools map in a complex<br/>way on the structure I have described, but significantly, we share a view of regulation as a con-<br/>stant trade-off between tools.<br/>
24. See, for example, James C. Carter, <i>The Provinces of the Written and the Unwritten Law</i><br/>

Civil Rights Act of 1964, supporters of the bill called before the committee white, southern<br/>employers and business owners whose discrimination against blacks was the prime target of the<br/>legislation. Some of these employers and businessmen supported the bill because business<br/>would improve: The labor pool would increase, causing wages to decrease, and the demand for<br/>services would increase—so long, that is, as whites did not shift their custom. This last point is<br/>what set the stage for business support for the Civil Rights Act. What business leaders feared<br/>was the retaliation of whites against their voluntary efforts to integrate. The Civil Rights Act<br/>changed the context to make discrimination against blacks illegal. The businessman could<br/>then—without fear of the retaliation of whites—hire or serve a black because of either his<br/>concern for the status of blacks or his concern to obey the law. By creating this ambiguity, the<br/>law reduced the symbolic costs of hiring blacks. This example demonstrates how law can<br/>change norms without government having control over the norms. In this case, the norm of<br/>accommodating blacks was changed by giving it a second meaning—the norm of simply obey-<br/>ing the law; see Lessig, “The Regulation of Social Meaning,” 965–67.<br/>

Alternatively,<br/>seatbelt laws have been used as the factual basis for critiques of norm sponsorship as ineffective<br/>and no substitute for direct regulation; see Robert S. Alder and R. David Pittle, “Cajolery or<br/>Command: Are Education Campaigns an Adequate Substitute for Regulation?” <i>Yale Journal on<br/>Regulation </i>1 (1984): 159, 171–78. However, the observations may have been premature. John<br/>C. Wright, commenting on television’s normative content, claims that “we have won the battle<br/>on seatbelts, just by a bunch of people getting together and saying, ‘It is indeed macho to put<br/>on a seatbelt. It is macho and it is smart and it is manly and it is also feminine and smart and<br/>

48. In the mid-1970s the U.S. government sponsored a campaign to spray paraquat (a her-<br/>
bicide that causes lung damage to humans) on the Mexican marijuana crop. This sparked a<br/>public outcry that resulted in congressional suspension of funding in 1978. However, following<br/>a congressional amendment in 1981, paraquat spraying was used on the domestic marijuana<br/>crop during the 1980s. The publicity surrounding the use of paraquat in Mexico is generally<br/>believed to have created a boom in the domestic marijuana industry and also an increase in the<br/>popularity of cocaine during the 1980s. See generally Michael Isikoff, “DEA Finds Herbicides<br/>in Marijuana Samples,” <i>Washington Post, </i>July 26, 1989, 17.

troubled history in philosophy as well as in law. Judith J.

This difference is also<br/>known as the “double effect doctrine,” discussed in Philippa Foot, “The Problem of Abortion<br/>and the Doctrine of the Double Effect,” in <i>Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philos-<br/>ophy </i>(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978), 19. See also Thomas J. Bole III, “The<br/>Doctrine of Double Effect: Its Philosophical Viability,” <i>Southwest Philosophy Review </i>7 (1991):<br/>91; Frances M. Kamm, “The Doctrine of Double Effect: Reflections on Theoretical and Practical<br/>Issues,” <i>Journal of Medicine and Philosophy </i>16 (1991): 571; Warren Quinn, “Actions, Intentions,<br/>and Consequences: The Doctrine of Double Effect,” <i>Philosophy and Public Affairs </i>18 (1989):<br/>334. The trouble in these cases comes when a line between them must be drawn; here I do not<br/>need to draw any such line.<br/>
54. Richard Craswell suggests other examples making the same point: The government<br/>
could (a) regulate product quality or safety directly or (b) disclose information about different<br/>products’ quality or safety ratings, in the hope that manufacturers would then have an incentive<br/>to compete to improve those ratings; the government could (a) allow an industry to remain<br/>monopolized and attempt directly to regulate the price the monopolist charged or (b) break up<br/>the monopolist into several competing firms, in the hope that competition would then force<br/>each to a more competitive price; the government could (a) pass regulations directly requiring<br/>corporations to do various things that would benefit the public interest or (b) pass regulations<br/>requiring that corporate boards of directors include a certain number of “independent” repre-<br/>sentatives, in the hope that the boards would then decide for themselves to act more consis-<br/>tently with the public interest.<br/>

using the standards-setting process for government purchases, the federal government could<br/>try to achieve a standard for encryption without adhering to the Administrative Procedure<br/>Act. “A stroke of bureaucratic genius lay at the heart of the Clipper strategy. Congress had not,<br/>and to this date has not, given the executive branch the power to control the private use of<br/>encryption. Congress has not even given the executive the power to set up an escrow system<br/>for keys. In the absence of any formal authority to prevent the adoption of unescrowed cryp-<br/>tography, Clipper’s proponents hit upon the idea of using the government’s power as a major<br/>consumer of cryptographic products to rig the market. If the government could not prevent<br/>the public from using nonconforming products, perhaps it could set the standard by purchas-<br/>ing and deploying large numbers of escrowed products”; “It Came from Planet Clipper,” 15,<br/>24, 1–33.<br/>

ates, 1997), 1–22, 6, 8; Loshin, <i>TCP/IP: Clearly Explained, </i>13–17.<br/>
10. There is no standard reference model for the TCP/IP layers. Hunt refers to the four lay-<br/>
ers as the “network access,” “internet,” “host-to-host transport,” and “application” layers;<br/><i>TCP/IP: Network Administration, </i>9. Loshin uses the terminology I follow in the text; <i>TCP/IP:<br/>Clearly Explained, </i>13–17. Despite the different moniker, the functions performed in each of<br/>these layers are consistent. As with any protocol stack model, data are “passed down the stack<br/>when it is being sent to the network, and up the stack when it is being received from the net-<br/>work.” Each layer “has its own independent data structures,” with one layer “unaware of the<br/>data structures used by” other layers; Hunt, <i>TCP/IP: Network Administration, </i>9.<br/>
11. Hunt, TCP/IP: Network Administration, 9; Loshin, TCP/IP: Clearly Explained, 13–17.<br/>12. As Hafner and Lyon explain: “The general view was that any protocol was a potential<br/>
building block, and so the best approach was to define simple protocols, each limited in scope,<br/>with the expectation that any of them might someday be joined or modified in various unan-<br/>ticipated ways. The protocol design philosophy adopted by the NWG [network working group]<br/>broke ground for what came to be widely accepted as the ‘layered’ approach to protocols”;<br/><i>Where Wizards Stay Up Late, </i>147.<br/>
13. The fights over encryption at the link level, for example, are fights over the TCP/IP<br/>
protocols. Some within the network industry have proposed that encryption be done at the<br/>gateways, with a method for dumping plain text at the gateways if there were proper legal<br/>authority—a kind of “private doorbell” for resolving the encryption controversy; see Elizabeth<br/>Kaufman and Roszel Thomsen II, “The Export of Certain Networking Encryption Products<br/>Under ELAs,” available at link #57. This has been opposed by the Internet Architectural Board<br/>(IAB) as inconsistent with the “end-to-end” architecture of the Internet; see IAB statement on<br/>“private doorbell” encryption, available at link #58.<br/>
Since <i>Code </i>v1<i>, </i>there has been an explosion of excellent work extending “layer theory.”<br/>
Perhaps the best academic work in this has been Lawrence B. Solum and Minn Chung, “The<br/>Layers Principle: Internet Architecture and the Law,” University of San Diego Public Law<br/>Research Paper No. 55, available at link #59. Solum and Chung have used the idea of Internet<br/>layers to guide regulatory policy, locating appropriate and inappropriate targets for regulatory<br/>intervention. This is an example of some of the best work integrating technology and legal<br/>policy, drawing interesting and important implications from the particular, often counter<br/>intuitive, interaction between the two. I introduce “layers” in my own work in <i>The Future of<br/>Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World </i>(New York: Random House, 2001),<br/>23–25. See also Yochai Benkler, <i>The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms<br/>Markets and Freedom </i>(New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006)<i>, </i>391–97.

16. Source code is the code that programmers write. It sometimes reads like a natural lan-<br/>
guage, but it is obviously not. A program is (ordinarily) written in source code, but to be run<br/>it must be converted into a language the computer can process. This is what a “compiler” does.<br/>Some source code is converted on the fly—BASIC, for example, is usually interpreted, meaning<br/>the computer compiles the source code as it is run. “Object code” is machine-readable. It is an<br/>undifferentiated string of 0s and 1s that instructs the machines about the tasks it is to perform.<br/>
17. Hypertext is text that is linked to another location in the same document or in another<br/>
document located either on the Net or on the same computer.<br/>

19. Of course, not always. When commercial production of computers began, software<br/>
was often a free addition to the computer. Its commercial development as proprietary came<br/>only later; see Ira V. Heffan, “Copyleft: Licensing Collaborative Works in the Digital Age,” <i>Stan-<br/>ford Law Review </i>49 (1997): 1487, 1492–93.<br/>
20. At the time Linux was developed, the dominant thinking among computer scientists<br/>
was against a monolithic operating system operating out of a single kernel and in favor of a<br/>“microkernel”-based system. MINIX, a microkernel system, was the primary competitor at<br/>the time. Torvalds consciously rejected this “modern” thinking and adopted the “traditional”<br/>model for Linux; see “The Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate,” in <i>Open Sources: Voices from the Open<br/>Source Revolution, </i>edited by Chris DiBona et al. (Sebastopol, Cal.: O’Reilly and Associates,<br/>1999), 221–51.<br/>
21. See the lists, “Ports of Linux” and Linux Online, “Hardware Port Projects” available at<br/>
link #61 and link #62.<br/>
22. Technically, it does not sit in the public domain. Code from these open source projects<br/>
is copyrighted and licensed. GNU/Linux is licensed under the GNU GPL, which limits the<br/>possible use you can make of Linux; essentially, you cannot take the public part and close it, and<br/>you cannot integrate the open part with the closed; see Bruce Perens, “The Open Source Def-<br/>inition,” in DiBona et al., <i>Open Sources, </i>181–82. But for purposes of future open source devel-<br/>opment, the code sits in the commons. On the idea and values of the commons, see, for<br/>example, Michael A. Heller, “The Tragedy of the Anticommons: Property in the Transition<br/>from Marx to Markets,” <i>Harvard Law Review </i>111 (1998): 621; Stephen M.

1. Justice Holmes himself called the wiretapping a “dirty business”; <i>Olmstead v. United</i><br/>

4. There is an extensive debate about the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment and<br/>
how it should be applied today. For the two camps, see Akhil Reed Amar, “Fourth Amendment<br/>First Principles,” <i>Harvard Law Review </i>107 (1994): 757; Tracey Maclin, “The Complexity of the<br/>Fourth Amendment: A Historical Review,” <i>Boston University Law Review </i>77 (1997): 925 (cri-<br/>tiquing Amar’s argument).<br/>

View from the Founding,” in <i>The Bill of Rights: Original Meaning and Current Understanding,<br/></i>edited by Eugene W. Hickok Jr. (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1991), 151,<br/>156–57. As many have pointed out, there were not really any “police” at that time in the sense<br/>that we understand the term today. The modern police force is a creation of the nineteenth cen-<br/>tury; see Carol S. Steiker, “Second Thoughts About First Principles,” <i>Harvard Law Review </i>107<br/>(1994): 820, 830–34; William J. Stuntz, “The Substantive Origins of Criminal Procedure,” <i>Yale<br/>Law Journal </i>105 (1995).<br/>
7. See Amar, “Fourth Amendment First Principles,” 767; Stuntz, “The Substantive Origins<br/>
of Criminal Procedure,” 400.<br/>
8. Indeed, as Professor William Stuntz argues quite effectively, one danger with warrants<br/>
in general is that judges become lax and yet the product of their work (the warrant) receives<br/>great deference in subsequent proceedings; “Warrants and Fourth Amendment Remedies,”<br/><i>Virginia Law Review </i>77 (1991): 881, 893.<br/>

15. “Translation” is not Brandeis’s term, though it is a term of the courts. The idea is best<br/>
captured by Justice Robert H. Jackson in <i>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, </i>319<br/>US 624, 639–40 (1943): “Nor does our duty to apply the Bill of Rights to assertions of official<br/>authority depend upon our possession of marked competence in the field where the invasion<br/>of rights occurs. True, the task of translating the majestic generalities of the Bill of Rights,<br/>conceived as part of the pattern of liberal government in the eighteenth century, into concrete<br/>restraints on officials dealing with the problems of the twentieth century, is one to disturb<br/>self-confidence. These principles grew in soil which also produced a philosophy that the indi-<br/>vidual was the center of society, that his liberty was attainable through mere absence of govern-<br/>mental restraints, and that government should be entrusted with few controls and only the<br/>mildest supervision over men’s affairs. We must transplant these rights to a soil in which the<br/>laissez-faire concept or principle of non-interference has withered at least as to economic<br/>affairs, and social advancements are increasingly sought through closer integration of society<br/>and through expanded and strengthened governmental controls. These changed conditions<br/>often deprive precedents of reliability and cast us more than we would choose upon our own<br/>judgment. But we act in these matters not by authority of our competence but by force of our<br/>commissions. We cannot, because of modest estimates of our competence in such specialties as<br/>public education, withhold the judgment that history authenticates as the function of this<br/>Court when liberty is infringed.”<br/>
16. See Robert Post, <i>Constitutional Domains: Democracy, Community, Management </i>(Cam-<br/>
bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1995), 60–64.<br/>
17. See Lessig, “Fidelity in Translation,” 1214–68; Lawrence Lessig, “Translating Federal-<br/>
ism: United States v Lopez,” <i>Supreme Court Review </i>1995 (1995): 125, 146.

Duffy, “Technological Change<br/>and Doctrinal Persistence: Telecommunications Reform in Congress and the Court,” <i>Columbia<br/>Law Review </i>97 (1997): 976.<br/>
18. So, for example, the translations to support federalism are translations on the right,<br/>
while the translations to support criminal rights are translations on the left.<br/>
19. <i>Katz v. United States, </i>389 US 347, 353 (1967).<br/>20. Laurence H. Tribe, “The Constitution in Cyberspace: Law and Liberty Beyond the<br/>
Electronic Frontier,” address at the First Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy,<br/>March 26, 1991, reprinted in <i>The Humanist </i>(September-October 1991): 15, 20–21.<br/>
21. <i>Katz v. United States, </i>389 US 347, 351 (1967).<br/>22. As the history of the Fourth Amendment’s protection of privacy since Katz will attest,<br/>
the technique used by Stewart was in the end quite ineffectual. When tied to property notions,<br/>no doubt the reach of the Fourth Amendment was narrow. But at least its reach went as far as<br/>the reach of property. Because “property” is a body of law independent of privacy questions, it<br/>was resilient to the pressures that privacy placed on it. But once the Court adopted the “reason-<br/>able expectation of privacy” test, it could later restrict these “reasonable expectations” in the<br/>Fourth Amendment context, with little consequence outside that context. The result has been<br/>an ever-decreasing scope for privacy’s protection.<br/>

2. This in the end was not his conclusion. He concluded instead, not that boundaries<br/>
should not be protected in cyberspace, but rather that the unconventional nature of cyber-<br/>space requires that boundaries be set along nontraditional context-specific lines. This conclu-<br/>sion, Reeves asserts, requires the law to understand both the environment of cyberspace and<br/>the interests of those who transact in that space; see ibid., 799.<br/>

6. There is a ferocious debate about whether these separate forms of regulation—copy-<br/>
right, patent, and trademark—should be referred to together as “Intellectual Property.” I<br/>myself have gone both ways on this question, but currently believe it is harmful not to refer<br/>to these distinct bodies of law as “intellectual property.” Though of course these domains are<br/>different, calling them by the same name doesn’t necessarily confuse (no one is confused<br/>

More<br/>importantly, by not calling them by the same name, we lose a chance to point out inconsisten-<br/>cies in the way these different forms of property are treated. For example, both patent and<br/>trademark benefit from significant formalities built into each system; when you notice those<br/>formalities are absent from “copyright,” one is led to wonder why one form of “intellectual<br/>property” is free of formalities, while the other two are not.<br/>
7. Paul Goldstein, <i>Copyright’s Highway: From Gutenberg to the Celestial Jukebox </i>(Stan-<br/>
ford: Stanford University Press, 2003) 64, 103: “Little did I realize at the time that this was all<br/>going to have its effect on television and motion pictures and VCRs, and the whole gamut of<br/>things which are affected by copyright law, which of course weren’t even thought of when we<br/>made our move. We were dealing with a fairly simple operation—Xerox. Now it’s become hor-<br/>ribly complicated.”<br/>

By contrast, Gary W. Glisson (“A Practi-<br/>tioner’s Defense of the White Paper,” <i>Oregon Law Review </i>75 [1996]: 277) argues that the<br/>White Paper is neither a misleading summary of the state of intellectual property law nor a<br/>proposal for dramatic changes.

10. The most important such threat is the anticircumvention provision of the Digital<br/>
Millennium Copyright Act, which makes it a crime (subject to complex exceptions) to man-<br/>ufacture code to circumvent a copyright protection mechanism, even if the use of the under-<br/>lying material itself would be a fair use; see Pub.L. 105–304, 112 Stat 2877 (1998) (prohibiting<br/>the manufacture, importation, or distribution of “devices, products, components” that “defeat<br/>technological methods of preventing unauthorized use”).<br/>

John Perry Barlow, “Papers and Comments of a Symposium on Fundamental Rights on the<br/>Information Superhighway,” <i>Annual Survey of American Law </i>1994 (1994): 355, 358. Barlow<br/>argues that “it is not so easy to own that which has never had any physical dimension what-<br/>soever,” unlike traditional forms of property. “We have tended to think,” he adds, “that copy-<br/>right worked well because it was physically difficult to transport intellectual properties<br/>without first manifesting them in some physical form. And it is no longer necessary to do<br/>that.”<br/>

of people can use an idea without using it up—ideas are readily appropriated from the creator<br/>by other people. Hence, copyright protection attempts to balance efficiently the benefits of cre-<br/>ating new works with the losses from limiting access and the costs of administering copyright<br/>protection; copyright protection seeks to promote the public benefit of advancing knowledge<br/>and learning by means of an incentive system. The economic rewards of the marketplace are<br/>offered to authors in order to stimulate them to produce and disseminate new works (326).

Copyright law does give authors a con-<br/>siderable benefit in terms of the monopolistic right to control their creations, but that right<br/>exists only to ensure the creation of new works. The fair use doctrine is an important safety<br/>valve that ensures that the benefit to individual authors does not outweigh the benefit to the<br/>public”; Marlin H. Smith (“The Limits of Copyright: Property, Parody, and the Public Domain,”<br/><i>Duke Law Journal </i>42 [1993]: 1233, 1272) asserts that “copyright law is better understood as that<br/>of a gatekeeper, controlling access to copyrighted works but guaranteeing, via fair use, some<br/>measure of availability to the public.”<br/>

that trends to increase the number of exclusive rights for authors are converting the public<br/>domain into private intellectual property and constraining other types of socially valuable<br/>uses of expressive works that do not fit the “authorship” model underlying American copyright<br/>traditions; he also argues that recent expansion of trademark law has allowed trademark own-<br/>ers to obtain property rights in their trademarks that do not further the Lanham Act’s goal of<br/>preventing consumer confusion.

declared to be otherwise.” In “Copyright as Myth” (<i>University of Pittsburgh Law Review </i>53<br/>[1991]: 235, 235–37), Litman provides a general overview of the issues of authorship and<br/>infringement in copyright law, indicating that debate continues regarding the definition of<br/>“authorship” (she defines “author”“in the copyright sense of anyone who creates copyrightable<br/>works, whether they be books, songs, sculptures, buildings, computer programs, paintings or<br/>films” [236, n.5]); she also discusses why copyright law is counterintuitive to the authorship<br/>process. See also “The Public Domain” (<i>Emory Law Journal </i>39 [1990]: 965, 969), in which Lit-<br/>man recommends a broad definition of the public domain (“originality is a keystone of copy-<br/>right law” [974]).

13. We’ve learned that the Defense Department is deeply involved in domestic intelligence<br/>
(intelligence concerning threats to national security that unfold on U.S. soil). The department’s<br/>National Security Agency has been conducting, outside the framework of the Foreign Intelli-<br/>gence Surveillance Act, electronic surveillance of U.S. citizens within the United States. Other<br/>Pentagon agencies, notably the one known as Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA), have,<br/>as described in Walter Pincus’s recent articles in the <i>Washington Post, </i>been conducting domestic<br/>intelligence on a large scale. Although the CIFA’s formal mission is to prevent attacks on mili-<br/>tary installations in the United States, the scale of its activities suggests a broader concern with<br/>domestic security. Other Pentagon agencies have gotten into the domestic intelligence act,<br/>such as the Information Dominance Center, which developed the Able Danger data-mining<br/>program.

Apartheid,” <i>UCLA Law Review </i>43 (1996): 1689, 1693–1704.<br/>
31. Examples of laws that aim at segregation based on social or economic criteria include:<br/>
regulations requiring a minimum lot size for housing; single-family ordinances prohibiting<br/>“nontraditional” families from living in certain areas; and residential classifications that exclude<br/>apartment housing. All such restrictions significantly increase the cost of housing for lower-<br/>income individuals; see ibid., 1699–1700.<br/>
32. In 1926 the Supreme Court held zoning to be a valid exercise of local governmental<br/>
power. See <i>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Company, </i>272 US 365 (1926) (holding that a state<br/>has the right to separate incompatible uses). Not until the twentieth century were municipal-<br/>ities given much power to regulate areas of law such as zoning decisions; see Richard Briffault,<br/>“Our Localism: Part I—The Structure of Local Government Law,” <i>Columbia Law Review </i>90<br/>(1990): 1, 8–11, 19.<br/>
33. In 1917 the Supreme Court outlawed racial zoning as a violation of the Fourteenth<br/>
Amendment; see <i>Buchanan v. Warley, </i>245 US 60 (1917). However, “nonexclusionary” zoning<br/>regulation was used to preserve residential segregation; even though racially neutral and based<br/>on economic factors (ostensibly to prevent property devaluation), various laws and regulations<br/>have resulted in de facto segregation; see Briffault, “Our Localism,” 103–4; Meredith Lee Bryant,<br/>“Combating School Resegregation Through Housing: A Need for a Reconceptualization of<br/>American Democracy and the Rights It Protects,” <i>Harvard BlackLetter Journal </i>13 (1997): 127,<br/>131–32.<br/>

tickets are the best example—the same seat can cost hundreds of dollars more for a traveler<br/>who cannot stay over Saturday night.

39. Susan Brenner puts the point very powerfully. As she frames the question, “is it reason-<br/>
able to translate the values incorporate in the Fourth Amendment into a context created and sus-<br/>tained by technology?” Susan Brenner, “The Privacy Privilege: Law Enforcement, Technology and<br/>the Constitution,” <i>Journal of Technology Law and Policy </i>7 (2002): 123, 162. The question isn’t<br/>simply whether anonymity has a value—plainly it does. The question instead is “how to translate<br/>rights devised to deal with real world conduct into [a world where] greater degrees of anonymity<br/>are possible. . . .” Ibid., 139–40. “Because the technology alters the contours of the empirical envi-<br/>ronment in which the right to remain anonymous is exercised, it creates a tension between this<br/>aspect of the right to be let alone and the needs of effective law enforcement.” Ibid., 144.<br/>
40. Shawn C. Helms, “Translating Privacy Values with Technology,” <i>Boston University</i><br/>
<i>Journal of Science and Technology Law </i>7 (2001): 288, 314. (“We should approach the translation<br/>of anonymity on the Internet through ‘code’ by developing and implementing privacy-enhanc-<br/>ing technologies.”)<br/>
41. As William McGeveran writes, Marc Rotenberg, one of privacy’s most important<br/>
advocate, doesn’t view P3P as a PET “because Rotenberg defines a PET as technology that<br/>inherently reduces transfer of personal data.” William McGeveran, “Programmed Privacy<br/>Promises: P3P and Web Privacy Law,” <i>New York University Law Review </i>76 (2001): 1813,<br/>1826–27 n.80. I share McGeveran’s view that P3P is a PET. If privacy is control over how infor-<br/>mation about you is released, then a technology that enhances that control is a PET even if it<br/>doesn’t “reduce[ the] transfer of personal data”—so long as that reduction is consistent with the<br/>preferences of the individual. No doubt, a PET could be a bad PET to the extent it fails to<br/>enable choice. But it isn’t a bad PET because it fails to enable the choice of someone other than<br/>the consumer.<br/>

Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral,” <i>Harvard Law Review </i>85 (1972): 1089, 1105–6.<br/>“Property rules involve a collective decision as to who is to be given an initial entitlement but<br/>

notes to chapter twelve<br/>
383<br/>
not as to the value of the entitlement. . . . Liability rules involve an additional stage of state inter-<br/>vention: not only are entitlements protected, but their transfer or destruction is allowed on the<br/>basis of a value determined by some organ of the state rather than by the parties themselves”<br/>(1092).<br/>
46. Ibid.<br/>47. See, e.g., Mark A. Lemley, “Private Property,” <i>Stanford Law Review </i>52 (2000): 1545,<br/>

Andrew Shapiro discusses a similar idea in<br/><i>The Control Revolution, </i>158–65.<br/>
48. See Neil M. Richards, “Reconciling Data Privacy and the First Amendment,” <i>UCLA</i><br/>
<i>Law Review </i>52 (2005): 1148, 116. Richards rightly identifies the brilliant Eugene Volokh as the<br/>strongest proponent of the view that the First Amendment restricts privacy property. But the<br/>comprehensive view Richards offers of the range of rules regulating privacy is quite persuasive<br/>against the Volokh position.<br/>

<i>New York University Law Review </i>76 (2001): 1813, 1843.<br/>
50. The important limit to contracts, however, is that they typically bind only people<br/>
“within privity,” meaning parties to the contract. Thus, an agreement I enter in with you about<br/>how you promise not to use a book I’ve sold you (e.g., a promise not to review it before a cer-<br/>tain date) won’t bind someone else who comes across the book and reads it.<br/>
51. As described above, the weakness is linked to the point above about “privity.” Unlike<br/>
a rule of property that travels automatically with the property, a rule built out of agreements<br/>reaches only as far as the agreements.<br/>

We are defending our privacy<br/>with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and<br/>with electronic money. Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software<br/>to defend privacy, and since we can’t get privacy unless we all do, we’re going to write it. We<br/>publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free<br/>for all to use, worldwide.”<br/>

15. The standard arguments are summarized well by Kathleen M. Sullivan and Gerald<br/>
Gunther: “(1) It is easier for an official to restrict speech ‘by a simple stroke of the pen’ than by<br/>the more cumbersome apparatus of subsequent punishment. . . . (2) Censors will have a pro-<br/>fessional bias in favor of censorship, and thus will systematically overvalue government interests<br/>and undervalue speech. (3) Censors operate more informally than judges and so afford less<br/>procedural safeguards to speakers. (4) Speech suppressed in advance never reaches the market-<br/>place of ideas at all. (5) When speech is suppressed in advance, there is no empirical evidence<br/>from which to measure its alleged likely harms”; <i>First Amendment Law </i>(New York: Foundation<br/>Press, 1999), 339–40, citing Thomas Emerson, “The Doctrine of Prior Restraint,” <i>Law and<br/>Contemporary Problems </i>20 (1955): 648. Frederick Schauer offers a nice balance to this com-<br/>monplace theory; see “Fear, Risk, and the First Amendment: Unraveling the ‘Chilling Effect,’”<br/><i>Boston University Law Review </i>58 (1978): 685, 725–30.<br/>
16. In a particularly telling exchange, Justice Stewart asked Professor Bickel about a case<br/>
in which disclosure “would result in the sentencing to death of a hundred young men whose<br/>only offense had been that they were nineteen years old and had low draft numbers. What<br/>should we do?” Bickel replied that his “inclinations of humanity overcome the somewhat more<br/>abstract devotion to the First Amendment in a case of that sort”; <i>May It Please the Court: The<br/>Most Significant Oral Arguments Made Before the Supreme Court Since 1955, </i>edited by Peter<br/>Irons and Stephanie Guitton (New York: Free Press, 1993), 173.<br/>
17. In a concurring opinion, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that the prior restraint at issue<br/>
was invalid since he could not “say that disclosure of [the Pentagon Papers] will surely result in<br/>direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to our Nation or its people”; <i>New York Times Com-<br/>pany v. United States, </i>403 US 713, 730 (1971) (per curiam). This standard has frequently been<br/>thought to reflect the position of the Court; see Laurence H. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law<br/></i>(Mineola, N.Y.: Foundation Press, 1978), 731; Morton H. Halperin and Daniel N. Hoffman, <i>Top<br/>Secret: National Security and the Right to Know </i>(Washington, D.C.: New Republic Books, 1977),<br/>147 n.22; see also <i>Alderman v.

New York, </i>390 US 629, 637–40 (1968). Child porn may be prohib-<br/>ited as obscene material even if it is not obscene under the Miller test, owing to the strong state<br/>interest in preventing the sexual exploitation of children; see <i>New York v.

(“The next information-flow membrane<br/>mandate to pass Congress—again, prompted by legislators’ fixation on indecent (but legal)<br/>content online—was the Children’s Internet Protection Act (“CIPA”), which required libraries<br/>to install filtering software on all their computers capable of accessing the Internet in order to<br/>hold on to their federal funding. The goal of this 2000 legislation was to condition provision of<br/>such funding on libraries’ use of filters that block access to visual depictions that are harmful<br/>to minors (when accessed by a minor). On June 23, 2003, after another three years of litigation,<br/>the Supreme Court upheld CIPA, with two “swing” Justices (Anthony Kennedy and Stephen<br/>Breyer) suggesting that adults would be able to ask libraries to unblock legal sites (legal for adult<br/>viewing, if harmful to minors) that had been blocked by the installed filters. Even though the<br/>tie to the CDA was clear—this was another congressional attempt to eliminate online sexual<br/>material using technology that would also inevitably filter out protected speech—the link to<br/>federal funding made this case one the Justices could decide differently. Indeed, the federal<br/>funding element may have been the crucial difference between CDA and CIPA. One European<br/>commentator noted the CIPA opinion as an ‘important shift’ by an American legal system that<br/>had been ‘previously critical of government’s attempts to regular Internet access.’”)<br/>

islation, see D. I. Cojocarasu, <i>Anti-spam Legislation Between Privacy and Commercial Interest:<br/>An Overview of the European Union Legislation Regarding the E-mail Spam </i>(Oslo: University of<br/>Oslo, 2006).<br/>
In my view, we define spam as “unsolicited bulk commercial e-mail.” Each element is<br/>
necessary. Unsolicited, meaning there is no agreement to receive such e-mail. If there is an<br/>agreement, the requirements would be removed. Bulk meaning it would not be intended to reg-<br/>ulate circulations to friends or within small groups. Cf. Sonia Arrison, “Canning Spam: An Eco-<br/>nomic Solution to Unwanted Email” 9 (Pacific Research Institute, Feb. 2004). Commercial<br/>meaning it would not regulate social or political e-mail. And e-mail, meaning maybe more than<br/>e-mail—perhaps, for example, including blog spam.<br/>
65. In my view, Congress should be permitted to discriminate in favor of political speech,<br/>
and should thus be permitted to exempt political speech from any “spam” regulation. This is<br/>not only because of the special value in this speech, but also, and more importantly, because<br/>abuse with political speech is more naturally regulated. If I am trying to win your vote, I’m not<br/>likely to annoy you with spam. But if I’m trying to sell you Viagra, whether I annoy you or not<br/>won’t matter much to me.<br/>
66. This was the law in many states before the federal CAN-SPAM Act preempted this state<br/>
law. But as those laws didn’t have the enforcement remedy I propose here, they are not directly<br/>relevant to the argument I am making here. See “Subject Line Labeling as a Weapon Against<br/>Spam,” A CAN-SPAM Act Report of Congress (FTC June 2005).<br/>
This solution is just one instance of a general form which aims to shift the burden of revealing<br/>

into each machine on that network. Each machine sniffs the data and then pays attention to the<br/>data intended for it.

13. There has been a rich, and sometimes unnecessary, debate about whether indeed<br/>
cyberspace is a “place.” I continue to believe the term is useful, and I am confirmed at least<br/>partly by Dan Hunter, “Cyberspace as Place and the Tragedy of the Digital Anti-commons,” <i>Cal-<br/>ifornia Law Review </i>91 (2003): 439. Michael Madison adds a valuable point about what the place<br/>metaphor misses in Michael J. Madison, “Rights of Access and the Shape of the Internet,”<br/><i>Boston College Law Review </i>44 (2003): 433. Lemley too adds an important perspective.

the level of nation-states, not U.S. states.<br/>
33. See Minnesota Statute 609.75, subd. 2–3, 609.755(1) (1994), making it a misde-<br/>

3. This is not to deny that some aspects of the equality delineated in the Civil War amend-<br/>
ments echoed in our constitutional past. The abolitionists, of course, made great weight of the<br/>Declaration of Independence’s claims to equality; see, for example, Trisha Olson, “The Natural<br/>Law Foundation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,”<br/><i>Arkansas Law Review </i>48 (1995): 347, 364. An amendment can be transformative, however,<br/>even if it is simply recalling a part of the past and reestablishing it—as Germany did, for exam-<br/>ple, after World War II.<br/>

(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1980).<br/>
11. I’ve overstated the security of the American judiciary. An incident with District Court<br/>
Judge Harold Baer suggests continued insecurity, especially in the context of the war on drugs.<br/>Baer released a criminal defendant after suppressing a search that had discovered eighty pounds<br/>of narcotics; Don Van Natta Jr., “Judge’s Drug Ruling Likely to Stand,” <i>New York Times, </i>January<br/>28, 1996, 27. The decision was then attacked by presidential candidate Robert Dole, who called<br/>for Baer’s impeachment; Katharine Q. Seelye, “A Get Tough Message at California’s Death<br/>Row,” <i>New York Times, </i>March 24, 1996, 29. President Clinton then joined the bandwagon, sug-<br/>gesting that he might ask for Baer’s resignation if Baer did not reverse his decision; Alison<br/>Mitchell, “Clinton Pressing Judge to Relent,” <i>New York Times, </i>March 22, 1996, 1. Baer then did<br/>reverse his decision; Don Van Natta Jr., “Under Pressure, Federal Judge Reverses Decision in<br/>Drug Case,” <i>New York Times, </i>April 2, 1996, 1. Chief Judge Jon Newman, of the Second Circuit<br/>Court of Appeals, along with other judges, then criticized Dole’s criticism of Baer, arguing<br/>that he went “too far”; Don Van Natta Jr., “Judges Defend a Colleague from Attacks,” <i>New York<br/>Times, </i>March 29, 1996, B1.<br/>

<i>Waite </i>(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1937), 82.<br/>
15. The relationship between a contested ground and a political judgment is more com-<br/>
plex than this suggests. I discuss it more extensively in Lawrence Lessig, “Fidelity and Con-<br/>straint,” <i>Fordham Law Review </i>65 (1997): 1365.<br/>

1996).<br/>
17. I discuss this in Lessig, “Fidelity and Constraint.”<br/>18. One could well argue that during the crisis of the Depression deference by the Court<br/>
to the Congress would have been well advised; see, for example, Sunstein, <i>Democracy and the<br/>Problem of Free Speech, </i>39.<br/>

7. “The phenomena of social meaning and incommensurability constrain rational choice<br/>
(individual and collective). Generalizing, it is irrational to treat goods as commensurable where<br/>the use of a quantitative metric effaces some dimension of meaning essential to one’s purposes<br/>or goals. It would be irrational, for example, for a person who wanted to be a good colleague<br/>within an academic community to offer another scholar cash instead of comments on her<br/>manuscript. Against the background of social norms, the comment’s signification of respect<br/>cannot be reproduced by any amount of money; even to attempt the substitution conveys that<br/>the person does not value his colleague in the way appropriate to their relationship”; Dan M.<br/>Kahan, “Punishment Incommensurability,” <i>Buffalo Criminal Law Review </i>1 (1998): 691, 695.<br/>
8. Many scholars, Robert Cooter most prominently among them, argue that norms are<br/>
special because they are “internalized” in a sense that other constraints are not; see Robert D.<br/>Cooter, “Decentralized Law for a Complex Economy: The Structural Approach to Adjudicating<br/>the New Law Merchant,” <i>University of Pennsylvania Law Review </i>144 (1996): 1643, 1662; Robert<br/>D. Cooter, “The Theory of Market Modernization of Law,” <i>International Review of Law and Eco-<br/>nomics </i>16 (1996): 141, 153. By internalization, Cooter is just describing the same sort of sub-<br/>jectivity that happens with the child and fire: the constraint moves from being an objectively<br/>ex post constraint to a subjectively ex ante constraint. The norm becomes a part of the person,<br/>such that the person feels its resistance before he acts, and hence its resistance controls his<br/>action before he acts. Once internalized, norms no longer need to be enforced to have force;<br/>their force has moved inside, as it were, and continues within this subjective perspective. In my<br/>view, we should see each constraint functioning in the same way: We subjectively come to<br/>account for the constraint through a process of internalization. Some internalization incentives<br/>may be stronger than others, of course. But that is just a difference.<br/>
