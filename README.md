# Code Version 2.0

The [official site for the book](codev2.cc/) only offers a PDF. There are some epub versions available around the web, notably [on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Code2.0/), but the formatting is not great. This repo is my attempt to convert that PDF into an epub with reasonably good formatting.
